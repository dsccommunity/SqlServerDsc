## Known error messages

### Error: The parameter is incorrect (HRESULT:-2147024809)

This is caused by trying to add an URL with the wrong format
i.e. 'htp://+:80'.

### Error: The Url has already been reserved (HRESULT:-2147220932)

This is caused when the URL is already reserved. For example when 'http://+:80'
already exist.

### Error: Cannot create a file when that file already exists (HRESULT:-2147024713)

This is caused when trying to add another URL using the same protocol. For example
when trying to add 'http://+:443' when 'http://+:80' already exist.
