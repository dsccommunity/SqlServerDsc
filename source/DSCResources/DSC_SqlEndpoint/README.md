it only supports creating a database mirror and a service broker endpoint. A database mirror
endpoint can be used by AlwaysOn.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The endpoint will be started after creation, but will not be enforced
> unless the the parameter `State` is specified.
>
> [!TIP]
> To set connect permission to the endpoint, please use
> the resource [**SqlEndpointPermission**](#sqlendpointpermission).
