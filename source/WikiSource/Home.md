## Getting started

To get started either:

- Install from the PowerShell Gallery using PowerShellGet by running the
  following command:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name SqlServerDsc -Repository PSGallery
```

- Download SqlServerDsc from the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/SqlServerDsc)
  and then unzip it to one of your PowerShell modules folders (such as
  `$env:ProgramFiles\WindowsPowerShell\Modules`).

To confirm installation, run the below command and ensure you see the SqlServerDsc
DSC resources available:

```powershell
Get-DscResource -Module SqlServerDsc
```

## Prerequisites

* Familiarity with Powershell DSC Framework
* Powershell 5.0 or higher
* SqlServer powershell module (optional)

### Familiarity with Powershell DSC Framework

SqlServerDSC implements configuration management for MS SQL using the [Powershell DSC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/search/?terms=Desired%20State%20Configuration&scope=PowerShell) technology developed by Microsoft.  A [community](https://dsccommunity.org/) maintains resources related to these [tools](https://dsccommunity.org/configmgt/).

### Powershell

The minimum Windows Management Framework (PowerShell) version required is 5.0
or higher, which ships with Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016,
but can also be installed on Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012,
and Windows Server 2012 R2.

### SqlServer powershell module (optional)

Optionally the PowerShell Module [_SqlServer_](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/SqlServer)
can be installed which then will be used instead of the PowerShell module
_SQLPS_ that is installed with SQL Server.

## Change log

A full list of changes in each version can be found in the [change log](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
