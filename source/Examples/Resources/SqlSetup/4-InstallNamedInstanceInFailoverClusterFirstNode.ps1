    .DESCRIPTION
        This example shows how to install the first node in a SQL Server failover cluster.

    .NOTES
        This example assumes that a Failover Cluster is already present with a Cluster Name Object (CNO), IP-address.
        This example also assumes that that all necessary shared disks is present, and formatted with the correct
        drive letter, to accommodate the paths used during SQL Server setup. Minimum is one shared disk.
        This example also assumes that the Cluster Name Object (CNO) has the permission to manage Computer Objects in
        the Organizational Unit (OU) where the CNO Computer Object resides in Active Directory. This is necessary
        so that SQL Server setup can create a Virtual Computer Object (VCO) for the cluster group
        (Windows Server 2012 R2 and earlier) or cluster role (Windows Server 2016 and later). Also so that the
        Virtual Computer Object (VCO) can be removed when the Failover CLuster instance is uninstalled.

        See the DSC resources xFailoverCluster, StorageDsc and iSCSIDsc for information how to setup a failover cluster
        with DSC.

        The resource is run using the SYSTEM account, but the setup is run using impersonation, with the credentials in
        SetupCredential, when Action is 'InstallFailoverCluster'.

        Assumes the credentials assigned to SourceCredential have read permission on the share and on the UNC path.
        The media will be copied locally, using impersonation with the credentials provided in SourceCredential, so
        that the impersonated credentials in SetupCredential can access the media locally.

        There is currently a bug that prevents the resource to logon to the instance if the current node is not the
        active node. This is because the resource tries to logon using the SYSTEM account instead of the credentials
        in SetupCredential, and the resource does not currently support the built-in PsDscRunAsCredential either (see
        issue #444).
