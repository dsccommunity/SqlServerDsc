          ReleaseNotes = '- Changes to xSQLServer
    - Updated Pester syntax to v4
    - Fixes broken links to issues in the CHANGELOG.md.
  - Changes to xSQLServerDatabase
    - Added parameter to specify collation for a database to be different from server
      collation ([issue 767](https://github.com/PowerShell/xSQLServer/issues/767)).
    - Fixed unit tests for Get-TargetResource to ensure correctly testing return
      values ([issue 849](https://github.com/PowerShell/xSQLServer/issues/849))
  - Changes to xSQLServerAlwaysOnAvailabilityGroup
    - Refactored the unit tests to allow them to be more user friendly and to test
      additional SQLServer variations.
      - Each test will utilize the Import-SQLModuleStub to ensure the correct
        module is loaded ([issue 784](https://github.com/PowerShell/xSQLServer/issues/784)).

      Domain Name (FQDN) ([issue 468](https://github.com/PowerShell/xSQLServer/issues/468)).

      resource will not attempt to apply the defaults on subsequent checks
      ([issue 517](https://github.com/PowerShell/xSQLServer/issues/517)).
    - Made the resource cluster aware. When ProcessOnlyOnActiveNode is specified,
      the resource will only determine if a change is needed if the target node
      is the active host of the SQL Server instance ([issue 868](https://github.com/PowerShell/xSQLServer/issues/868)).
  - Changes to xSQLServerAlwaysOnAvailabilityGroupDatabaseMembership
    - Made the resource cluster aware. When ProcessOnlyOnActiveNode is specified,
      the resource will only determine if a change is needed if the target node
      is the active host of the SQL Server instance ([issue 869](https://github.com/PowerShell/xSQLServer/issues/869)).
  - Changes to xSQLServerAlwaysOnAvailabilityGroupReplica
    - Made the resource cluster aware. When ProcessOnlyOnActiveNode is specified,
      the resource will only determine if a change is needed if the target node is
      the active host of the SQL Server instance ([issue 870](https://github.com/PowerShell/xSQLServer/issues/870)).
  - Added the CommonTestHelper.psm1 to store common testing functions.
    - Added the Import-SQLModuleStub function to ensure the correct version of the
      module stubs are loaded ([issue 784](https://github.com/PowerShell/xSQLServer/issues/784)).
  - Changes to xSQLServerMemory
    - Made the resource cluster aware. When ProcessOnlyOnActiveNode is specified,
      the resource will only determine if a change is needed if the target node
      is the active host of the SQL Server instance ([issue 867](https://github.com/PowerShell/xSQLServer/issues/867)).
  - Changes to xSQLServerNetwork
    - BREAKING CHANGE: Renamed parameter TcpDynamicPorts to TcpDynamicPort and
      changed type to Boolean ([issue 534](https://github.com/PowerShell/xSQLServer/issues/534)).

      configuration ([issue 534](https://github.com/PowerShell/xSQLServer/issues/534)).

      the resource will only determine if a change is needed if the target node
      is the active host of the SQL Server instance ([issue 882](https://github.com/PowerShell/xSQLServer/issues/882)).
