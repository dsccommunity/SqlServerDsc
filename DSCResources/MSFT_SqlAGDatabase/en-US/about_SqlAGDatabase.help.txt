SYNOPSIS
    Adds or removes databases to the specified availability group.

PARAMETER DatabaseName
    The name of the database(s) to add to the availability group. This accepts wildcards.

PARAMETER ServerName
    Hostname of the SQL Server where the primary replica of the availability group lives. If the
    availability group is not currently on this server, the resource will attempt to connect to the
    server where the primary replica lives.

PARAMETER InstanceName
    Name of the SQL instance where the primary replica of the availability group lives. If the
    availability group is not currently on this instance, the resource will attempt to connect to
    the instance where the primary replica lives.

PARAMETER AvailabilityGroupName
    The name of the availability group in which to manage the database membership(s).

PARAMETER BackupPath
    The path used to seed the availability group replicas. This should be a path that is accessible
    by all of the replicas.

PARAMETER Ensure
    Specifies the membership of the database(s) in the availability group. The options are:

        - Present:  The defined database(s) are added to the availability group. All other
                    databases that may be a member of the availability group are ignored.
        - Absent:   The defined database(s) are removed from the availability group. All other
                    databases that may be a member of the availability group are ignored.

    The default is 'Present'.

PARAMETER Force
    When used with "Ensure = 'Present'" it ensures the specified database(s) are the only databases
    that are a member of the specified Availability Group.

    This parameter is ignored when 'Ensure' is 'Absent'.

PARAMETER MatchDatabaseOwner
    If set to $true, this ensures the database owner of the database on the primary replica is the
    owner of the database on all secondary replicas. This requires the database owner is available
    as a login on all replicas and that the PSDscRunAsCredential has impersonate permissions.

    If set to $false, the owner of the database will be the PSDscRunAsCredential.

    The default is '$true'.

.PARAMETER ProcessOnlyOnActiveNode
        Specifies that the resource will only determine if a change is needed if the target node is the active host of the SQL Server Instance.
