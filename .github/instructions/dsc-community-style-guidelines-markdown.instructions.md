# Markdown Style Guidelines

- Wrap lines at word boundaries when over 80 characters (except tables/code blocks)
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use '1.' for all items in ordered lists (1/1/1 numbering style)
- Surround fenced code blocks with blank lines
- Disable `MD013` rule for tables/code blocks exceeding 80 characters
