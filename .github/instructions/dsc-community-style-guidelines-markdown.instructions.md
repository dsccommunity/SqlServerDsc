# Guidelines for Markdown

## Line length not longer than 80 characters

Rows longer than 80 characters should be split into multiple lines where appropriate.
This helps make it easier for reviewers to make review comments and for the
contributors to see where the requested changes are (without scrolling).
It is also easier to see the lines in split view mode when the lines don't wrap
on the screen. It will also improve the readability when using `git diff`.
