# Changelog Style Guidelines

Always update the Unreleased section in CHANGELOG.md with every change.
Use the Keep a Changelog format and provide concrete release notes that
describe the main changes. Include new commands, private functions,
class-based resources, or significant modifications to existing
functionality.

Reference related issues using the format #<issue_number>.

Do not leave empty lines between list items in the same section.
