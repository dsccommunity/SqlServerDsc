# Changelog Style Guidelines

The Unreleased section in CHANGELOG.md should always be updated when making
changes to the codebase. Use the keepachangelog format and provide concrete
release notes that describe the main changes made. This includes new commands,
private functions, class-based resources, or significant modifications to
existing functionality.

Reference any issue numbers related to the changes made, using the format `#<issue_number>`.

Do not leave empty lines between list items in the same section.
