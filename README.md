### xSQLServerMaxDop

This resource set the max degree of parallelism server configuration option.
The max degree of parallelism option is used to limit the number of processors to use in parallel plan execution.
Read more about max degree of parallelism in this article [Configure the max degree of parallelism Server Configuration Option](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189094.aspx)

#### Formula for dynamically allocating max degree of parallelism

* If the number of configured NUMA nodes configured in SQL Server equals 1, then max degree of parallelism is calculated using number of cores divided in 2 (numberOfCores / 2), then rounded up to the next integer (3.5 > 4).
* If the number of cores configured in SQL Server are greater than or equal to 8 cores then max degree of parallelism will be set to 8.
* If the number of configured NUMA nodes configured in SQL Server is greater than 2 and thenumber of cores are less than 8 then max degree of parallelism will be set to the number of cores.

#### Requirements

* Target machine must be running Windows Server 2008 R2 or later.

When set to 'Absent' max degree of parallelism will be set to 0 which means no limit in number of processors used in parallel plan execution. { *Present* | Absent }.
* **[Boolean] DynamicAlloc** _(Write)_: If set to $true then max degree of parallelism will be dynamically configured. When this is set parameter is set to $true, the parameter MaxDop must be set to $null or not be configured.

### xSQLServerMemory

This resource sets the minimum server memory and maximum server memory configuration option.
That means it sets the minimum and the maximum amount of memory, in MB, in the buffer pool used by the instance of SQL Server
The default setting for minimum server memory is 0, and the default setting for maximum server memory is 2147483647 MB.
Read more about minimum server memory and maximum server memory in this article [Server Memory Server Configuration Options](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178067.aspx).

#### Formula for dynamically allocating maximum memory

The formula is based on the [SQL Max Memory Calculator](http://sqlmax.chuvash.eu/) website. The website code is in the sql-max GitHub repository maintained by [@mirontoli](https://github.com/mirontoli).
The dynamic maximum memory (in MB) is calculate with this formula:
SQL Max Memory = TotalPhysicalMemory - (NumOfSQLThreads\*ThreadStackSize) - (1024\*CEILING(NumOfCores/4)) - OSReservedMemory.

* **NumOfSQLThreads**
  * If the number of cores is less than or equal to 4, the number of SQL threads is set to: 256 + (NumberOfCores - 4) \* 8.
  * If the number of cores is greater than 4, the number of SQL threads is set to: 0 (zero).
* **ThreadStackSize**
  * If the architecture of windows server is x86, the size of thread stack is 1MB.
  * If the architecture of windows server is x64, the size of thread stack is 2MB.
  * If the architecture of windows server is IA64, the size of thread stack is 4MB.
* **OSReservedMemory**
  * If the total physical memory is less than or equal to 20GB, the percentage of reserved memory for OS is 20% of total physical memory.
  * If the total physical memory is greater than 20GB, the percentage of reserved memory for OS is 12.5% of total physical memory.

When set to 'Absent' min and max memory will be set to default values. { *Present* | Absent }.

#### Requirements

* Target machine must be running Windows Server 2008 R2 or later.
* Target machine must be running SQL Server 2008 or later.
* Target machine must have access to the SQLPS PowerShell module or the SqlServer PowerShell module.
