- Changes to xSQLServerRole
  - **BREAKING CHANGE: The resource has been reworked in it's entirely.** Below is what has changed.
    - The mandatory parameters now also include ServerRoleName.
    - The ServerRole parameter was before an array of server roles, now this parameter is renamed to ServerRoleName and can only be set to one server role.
      - ServerRoleName are no longer limited to built-in server roles. To add members to a built-in server role, set ServerRoleName to the name of the built-in server role.
      - The ServerRoleName will be created when Ensure is set to 'Present' (if it does not already exist), or removed if Ensure is set to 'Absent'.
    - Three new parameters are added; Members, MembersToInclude and MembersToExclude.
      - Members can be set to one or more logins, and those will _replace all_ the memberships in the server role.
      - MembersToInclude and MembersToExclude can be set to one or more logins that will add or remove memberships, respectively, in the server role. MembersToInclude and MembersToExclude _can not_ be used at the same time as parameter Members. But both MembersToInclude and MembersToExclude can be used together at the same time.
- Changes to xSQLServerSetup
  - Added a note to the README.md saying that it is not possible to add or remove features from a SQL Server failover cluster (issue #433).
  - Changed so that it reports false if the desired state is not correct (issue #432).
    - Added a test to make sure we always return false if a SQL Server failover cluster is missing features.
  - Helper function Connect-SQLAnalysis
    - Now has correct error handling, and throw does not used the unknown named parameter '-Message' (issue #436)
    - Added tests for Connect-SQLAnalysis
    - Changed to localized error messages.
    - Minor changes to error handling.
  - This adds better support for Addnode (issue #369).
  - Now it skips cluster validation för add node (issue #442).
  - Now it ignores parameters that are not allowed for action Addnode (issue #441).
  - Added support for vNext CTP 1.4 (issue #472).
- Added new resource
  - xSQLServerAlwaysOnAvailabilityGroupReplica
- Changes to xSQLServerDatabaseRecoveryModel
  - Fixed code style, removed SQLServerDatabaseRecoveryModel functions from xSQLServerHelper.
- Changes to xSQLServerAlwaysOnAvailabilityGroup
  - Fixed the permissions check loop so that it exits the loop after the function determines the required permissions are in place.
- Changes to xSQLServerAvailabilityGroupListener
  - Removed the dependency of SQLPS provider (issue #460).
  - Cleaned up code.
  - Added test for more coverage.
  - Fixed PSSA rule warnings (issue #255).

- Changes to xSQLServerEndpointPermission
  - Added description to the README.md
  - Cleaned up code (issue #257 and issue #231)
  - Now the default value for Ensure is 'Present'.
  - Removed dependency of SQLPS provider (issue #483).
  - Refactored tests so they use less code.
- Changes to README.md
  - Adding deprecated tag to xSQLServerFailoverClusterSetup, xSQLAOGroupEnsure and xSQLAOGroupJoin in README.md so it it more clear that these resources has been replaced by xSQLServerSetup, xSQLServerAlwaysOnAvailabilityGroup and xSQLServerAlwaysOnAvailabilityGroupReplica respectively.
- Changes to xSQLServerEndpoint
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Now SQLInstanceName is mandatory, and is a key, so SQLInstanceName has no longer a default value (issue #279).
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Parameter AuthorizedUser has been removed (issue #466, issue #275 and issue #80). Connect permissions can be set using the resource xSQLServerEndpointPermission.
  - Optional parameter IpAddress has been added. Default is to listen on any valid IP-address. (issue #232)
  - Parameter Port now has a default value of 5022.
  - Parameter Ensure now defaults to 'Present'.
  - Resource now supports changing IP address and changing port.
  - Added unit tests (issue #289)
  - Added examples.
- Changes to xSQLServerEndpointState
  - Cleaned up code, removed SupportsShouldProcess and fixed PSSA rules warnings (issue #258 and issue #230).
  - Now the default value for the parameter State is 'Started'.
  - Updated README.md with a description for the resources and revised the parameter descriptions.
  - Removed dependency of SQLPS provider (issue #481).
  - The parameter NodeName is no longer mandatory and has now the default value of $env:COMPUTERNAME.
  - The parameter Name is now a key so it is now possible to change the state on more than one endpoint on the same instance. _Note: The resource still only supports Database Mirror endpoints at this time._
- Changes to xSQLServerHelper module
  - Removing helper function Get-SQLAlwaysOnEndpoint because there is no resource using it any longer.
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Changed helper function Import-SQLPSModule to support SqlServer module (issue #91). The SqlServer module is the preferred module so if it is found it will be used, and if not found an attempt will be done to load SQLPS module instead.
- Changes to xSQLServerScript
  - Updated tests for this resource, because they failed when Import-SQLPSModule was updated.

## 6.0.0.0

- Changes to xSQLServerConfiguration
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The parameter SQLInstanceName is now mandatory.
  - Resource can now be used to define the configuration of two or more different DB instances on the same server.
- Changes to xSQLServerRole
  - xSQLServerRole now correctly reports that the desired state is present when the login is already a member of the server roles.
- Added new resources
  - xSQLServerAlwaysOnAvailabilityGroup
- Changes to xSQLServerSetup
  - Properly checks for use of SQLSysAdminAccounts parameter in $PSBoundParameters. The test now also properly evaluates the setup argument for SQLSysAdminAccounts.
  - xSQLServerSetup should now function correctly for the InstallFailoverCluster action, and also supports cluster shared volumes. Note that the AddNode action is not currently working.
  - It now detects that feature Client Connectivity Tools (CONN) and Client Connectivity Backwards Compatibility Tools (BC) is installed.
  - Now it can correctly determine the right cluster when only parameter InstallSQLDataDir is assigned a path (issue #401).
  - Now the only mandatory path parameter is InstallSQLDataDir when installing Database Engine (issue #400).
  - It now can handle mandatory parameters, and are not using wildcard to find the variables containing paths (issue #394).
  - Changed so that instead of connection to localhost it is using $env:COMPUTERNAME as the host name to which it connects. And for cluster installation it uses the parameter FailoverClusterNetworkName as the host name to which it connects (issue #407).
  - When called with Action = 'PrepareFailoverCluster', the SQLSysAdminAccounts and FailoverClusterGroup parameters are no longer passed to the setup process (issues #410 and 411).
  - Solved the problem that InstanceDir and InstallSQLDataDir could not be set to just a qualifier, i.e 'E:' (issue #418). All paths (except SourcePath) can now be set to just the qualifier.
- Enables CodeCov.io code coverage reporting.
- Added badge for CodeCov.io to README.md.
