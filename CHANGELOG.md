## 8.0.0.0

- BREAKING CHANGE: The module now requires WMF 5.
  - This is required for class-based resources
- Added new resource
  - xSQLServerAlwaysOnAvailabilityGroupDatabaseMembership
  - Added localization support for all strings.
  - Refactored as a MOF based resource due to challenges with Pester and testing
    in Powershell 5.
- Changes to xSQLServer
  - BREAKING CHANGE: xSQLServer does no longer try to support WMF 4.0 (PowerShell
    4.0) (issue #574). Minimum supported version of WMF is now 5.0 (PowerShell 5.0).
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Removed deprecated resource xSQLAOGroupJoin (issue #457).
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Removed deprecated resource xSQLAOGroupEnsure (issue #456).
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Removed deprecated resource xSQLServerFailoverClusterSetup
    (issue #336).
  - Updated PULL\_REQUEST\_TEMPLATE adding comment block around text. Also
    rearranged and updated texts (issue #572).
  - Added common helper functions for HQRM localization, and added tests for the
    helper functions.
    - Get-LocalizedData
    - New-InvalidResultException
    - New-ObjectNotFoundException
    - New-InvalidOperationException
    - New-InvalidArgumentException
  - Updated CONTRIBUTING.md describing the new localization helper functions.
  - Fixed typos in xSQLServer.strings.psd1
  - Fixed CodeCov badge links in README.md so that they point to the correct branch.
  - Added VS Code workspace settings file with formatting settings matching the
    Style Guideline (issue #645). That will make it possible inside VS Code to press
    SHIFT+ALT+F, or press F1 and choose 'Format document' in the list. The
    PowerShell code will then be formatted according to the Style Guideline
    (although maybe not complete, but would help a long way).
      - Removed powershell.codeFormatting.alignPropertyValuePairs setting since
        it does not align with the style guideline.
      - Added powershell.codeFormatting.preset with a value of 'Custom' so that
        workspace formatting settings are honored (issue #665).
  - Fixed lint error MD013 and MD036 in README.md.
  - Updated .markdownlint.json to enable rule MD013 and MD036 to enforce those
    lint markdown rules in the common tests.
  - Fixed lint error MD013 in CHANGELOG.md.
  - Fixed lint error MD013 in CONTRIBUTING.md.
  - Added code block around types in README.md.
  - Updated copyright information in xSQLServer.psd1.
  - Opt-in for markdown common tests (issue #668).
    - The old markdown tests has been removed.
- Changes to xSQLServerHelper
  - Removed helper function Grant-ServerPerms because the deprecated resource that
    was using it was removed.
  - Removed helper function Grant-CNOPerms because the deprecated resource that
    was using it was removed.
  - Removed helper function New-ListenerADObject because the deprecated resource
    that was using it was removed.
  - Added tests for those helper functions that did not have tests.
  - Test-SQLDscParameterState helper function can now correctly pass a CimInstance
    as DesiredValue.
  - Test-SQLDscParameterState helper function will now output a warning message
    if the value type of a desired value is not supported.
  - Added localization to helper functions (issue #641).
    - Resolved the issue when using Write-Verbose in helper functions discussed
      in #641 where Write-Verbose wouldn't write out verbose messages unless using
      parameter Verbose.
    - Moved localization strings from xSQLServer.strings.psd1 to
      xSQLServerHelper.strings.psd1.
- Changes to xSQLServerSetup
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Replaced StartWin32Process helper function with the cmdlet
    Start-Process (issue #41, #93 and #126).
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The parameter SetupCredential has been removed since it is
    no longer needed. This is because the resource now support the built-in
    PsDscRunAsCredential.
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Now the resource supports using built-in PsDscRunAsCredential.
    If PsDscRunAsCredential is set, that username will be used as the first system
    administrator.
  - BREAKING CHANGE: If the parameter PsDscRunAsCredential are not assigned any
    credentials then the resource will start the setup process as the SYSTEM account.
    When installing as the SYSTEM account, then parameter SQLSysAdminAccounts and
    ASSysAdminAccounts must be specified when installing feature Database Engine
    and Analysis Services respectively.
  - When setup exits with the exit code 3010 a warning message is written to console
    telling that setup finished successfully, but a reboot is required (partly fixes
    issue #565).
  - When setup exits with an exit code other than 0 or 3010 a warning message is
    written to console telling that setup finished with an error (partly fixes
    issue #580).
  - Added a new parameter SetupProcessTimeout which defaults to 7200 seconds (2
    hours). If the setup process has not finished before the timeout value in
    SetupProcessTimeout an error will be thrown (issue #566).
  - Updated all examples to match the removal of SetupCredential.
  - Updated (removed) severe known issues in README.md for resource xSQLServerSetup.
  - Now all major version uses the same identifier to evaluate InstallSharedDir
    and InstallSharedWOWDir (issue #420).
  - Now setup arguments that contain no value will be ignored, for example when
    InstallSharedDir and
    InstallSharedWOWDir path is already present on the target node, because of a
    previous installation (issue #639).
  - Updated Get-TargetResource to correctly detect BOL, Conn, BC and other tools
    when they are installed without SQLENGINE (issue #591).
  - Now it can detect Documentation Components correctly after the change in
    issue #591 (issue #628)
  - Fixed bug that prevented Get-DscConfiguration from running without error. The
    return hash table fails if the $clusteredSqlIpAddress variable is not used.
    The schema expects a string array but it is initialized as just a null string,
    causing it to fail on Get-DscConfiguration (issue #393).
  - Added localization support for all strings.
  - Added a test to test some error handling for cluster installations.
  - Added support for MDS feature install (issue #486)
    - Fixed localization support for MDS feature (issue #671).
- Changes to xSQLServerRSConfig
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Removed `$SQLAdminCredential` parameter. Use common parameter
    `PsDscRunAsCredential` (WMF 5.0+) to run the resource under different credentials.
    `PsDscRunAsCredential` Windows account must be a sysadmin on SQL Server (issue
    #568).
  - In addition, the resource no longer uses `Invoke-Command` cmdlet that was used
    to impersonate the Windows user specified by `$SQLAdminCredential`. The call
    also needed CredSSP authentication to be enabled and configured on the target
    node, which complicated deployments in non-domain scenarios. Using
    `PsDscRunAsCredential` solves this problems for us.
  - Fixed virtual directory creation for SQL Server 2016 (issue #569).
  - Added unit tests (issue #295).
- Changes to xSQLServerDatabase
  - Changed the readme, SQLInstance should have been SQLInstanceName.
- Changes to xSQLServerScript
  - Fixed bug with schema and variable mismatch for the Credential/Username parameter
    in the return statement (issue #661).
  - Optional QueryTimeout parameter to specify sql script query execution timeout.
    Fixes issue #597
- Changes to xSQLServerAlwaysOnService
  - Fixed typos in localization strings and in tests.
- Changes to xSQLServerAlwaysOnAvailabilityGroup
  - Now it utilize the value of 'FailoverMode' to set the 'FailoverMode' property
    of the Availability Group instead of wrongly using the 'AvailabilityMode'
    property of the Availability Group.

## 7.1.0.0

- Changes to xSQLServerMemory
  - Changed the way SQLServer parameter is passed from Test-TargetResource to
    Get-TargetResource so that the default value isn't lost (issue #576).
  - Added condition to unit tests for when no SQLServer parameter is set.
- Changes to xSQLServerMaxDop
  - Changed the way SQLServer parameter is passed from Test-TargetResource to
    Get-TargetResource so that the default value isn't lost (issue #576).
  - Added condition to unit tests for when no SQLServer parameter is set.
- Changes to xWaitForAvailabilityGroup
  - Updated README.md with a description for the resources and revised the parameter
    descriptions.
  - The default value for RetryIntervalSec is now 20 seconds and the default value
    for RetryCount is now 30 times (issue #505).
  - Cleaned up code and fixed PSSA rules warnings (issue #268).
  - Added unit tests (issue #297).
  - Added descriptive text to README.md that the account that runs the resource
    must have permission to run the cmdlet Get-ClusterGroup (issue #307).
  - Added read-only parameter GroupExist which will return $true if the cluster
    role/group exist, otherwise it returns $false (issue #510).
  - Added examples.
- Changes to xSQLServerPermission
  - Cleaned up code, removed SupportsShouldProcess and fixed PSSA rules warnings
    (issue #241 and issue #262).
  - It is now possible to add permissions to two or more logins on the same instance
    (issue #526).
  - The parameter NodeName is no longer mandatory and has now the default value
    of $env:COMPUTERNAME.
  - The parameter Ensure now has a default value of 'Present'.
  - Updated README.md with a description for the resources and revised the parameter
    descriptions.
  - Removed dependency of SQLPS provider (issue #482).
  - Added ConnectSql permission. Now that permission can also be granted or revoked.
  - Updated note in resource description to also mention ConnectSql permission.
- Changes to xSQLServerHelper module
  - Removed helper function Get-SQLPSInstance and Get-SQLPSInstanceName because
    there is no resource using it any longer.
  - Added four new helper functions.
    - Register-SqlSmo, Register-SqlWmiManagement and Unregister-SqlAssemblies to
      handle the creation on the application domain and loading and unloading of
      the SMO and SqlWmiManagement assemblies.
    - Get-SqlInstanceMajorVersion to get the major SQL version for a specific instance.
  - Fixed typos in comment-based help
- Changes to xSQLServer
  - Fixed typos in markdown files; CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, README and ISSUE_TEMPLATE.
  - Fixed typos in schema.mof files (and README.md).
  - Updated some parameter description in schema.mof files on those that was found
    was not equal to README.md.
- Changes to xSQLServerAlwaysOnService
  - Get-TargetResource should no longer fail silently with error 'Index operation
    failed; the array index evaluated to null.' (issue #519). Now if the
    Server.IsHadrEnabled property return neither $true or $false the
    Get-TargetResource function will throw an error.
- Changes to xSQLServerSetUp
  - Updated xSQLServerSetup Module Get-Resource method to fix (issue #516 and #490).
  - Added change to detect DQ, DQC, BOL, SDK features. Now the function
    Test-TargetResource returns true after calling set for DQ, DQC, BOL, SDK
    features (issue #516 and #490).
- Changes to xSQLServerAlwaysOnAvailabilityGroup
  - Updated to return the exception raised when an error is thrown.
- Changes to xSQLServerAlwaysOnAvailabilityGroupReplica
  - Updated to return the exception raised when an error is thrown.
  - Updated parameter description for parameter Name, so that it says it must be
    in the format SQLServer\InstanceName for named instance (issue #548).
- Changes to xSQLServerLogin
  - Added an optional boolean parameter Disabled. It can be used to enable/disable
    existing logins or create disabled logins (new logins are created as enabled
    by default).
- Changes to xSQLServerDatabaseRole
  - Updated variable passed to Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.User constructor
    to fix issue #530
- Changes to xSQLServerNetwork
  - Added optional parameter SQLServer with default value of $env:COMPUTERNAME
    (issue #528).
  - Added optional parameter RestartTimeout with default value of 120 seconds.
  - Now the resource supports restarting a sql server in a cluster (issue #527
    and issue #455).
  - Now the resource allows to set the parameter TcpDynamicPorts to a blank value
    (partly fixes issue #534). Setting a blank value for parameter TcpDynamicPorts
    together with a value for parameter TcpPort means that static port will be used.
  - Now the resource will not call Alter() in the Set-TargetResource when there
    is no change necessary (issue #537).
  - Updated example 1-EnableTcpIpOnCustomStaticPort.
  - Added unit tests (issue #294).
  - Refactored some of the code, cleaned up the rest and fixed PSSA rules warnings
    (issue #261).
  - If parameter TcpDynamicPort is set to '0' at the same time as TcpPort is set
    the resource will now throw an error (issue #535).
  - Added examples (issue #536).
  - When TcpDynamicPorts is set to '0' the Test-TargetResource function will no
    longer fail each time (issue #564).
- Changes to xSQLServerRSConfig
  - Replaced sqlcmd.exe usages with Invoke-Sqlcmd calls (issue #567).
- Changes to xSQLServerDatabasePermission
  - Fixed code style, updated README.md and removed *-SqlDatabasePermission functions
    from xSQLServerHelper.psm1.
  - Added the option 'GrantWithGrant' with gives the user grant rights, together
    with the ability to grant others the same right.
  - Now the resource can revoke permission correctly (issue #454). When revoking
    'GrantWithGrant', both the grantee and all the other users the grantee has
    granted the same permission to, will also get their permission revoked.
  - Updated tests to cover Revoke().
- Changes to xSQLServerHelper
  - The missing helper function ('Test-SPDSCObjectHasProperty'), that was referenced
    in the helper function Test-SQLDscParameterState, is now incorporated into
    Test-SQLDscParameterState (issue #589).

- Changes to xSQLServer
  - Raised the CodeCov target to 70% which is the minimum and required target for
    HQRM resource.
- Changes to xSQLServerRole
  - **BREAKING CHANGE: The resource has been reworked in it's entirely.** Below
    is what has changed.
    - The mandatory parameters now also include ServerRoleName.
    - The ServerRole parameter was before an array of server roles, now this parameter
      is renamed to ServerRoleName and can only be set to one server role.
      - ServerRoleName are no longer limited to built-in server roles. To add members
        to a built-in server role, set ServerRoleName to the name of the built-in
        server role.
      - The ServerRoleName will be created when Ensure is set to 'Present' (if it
        does not already exist), or removed if Ensure is set to 'Absent'.
    - Three new parameters are added; Members, MembersToInclude and MembersToExclude.
      - Members can be set to one or more logins, and those will _replace all_ the
        memberships in the server role.
      - MembersToInclude and MembersToExclude can be set to one or more logins that
        will add or remove memberships, respectively, in the server role. MembersToInclude
        and MembersToExclude _can not_ be used at the same time as parameter Members.
        But both MembersToInclude and MembersToExclude can be used together at the
        same time.
- Changes to xSQLServerSetup
  - Added a note to the README.md saying that it is not possible to add or remove
    features from a SQL Server failover cluster (issue #433).
  - Changed so that it reports false if the desired state is not correct (issue #432).
    - Added a test to make sure we always return false if a SQL Server failover
      cluster is missing features.
  - Helper function Connect-SQLAnalysis
    - Now has correct error handling, and throw does not used the unknown named
      parameter '-Message' (issue #436)
    - Added tests for Connect-SQLAnalysis
    - Changed to localized error messages.
    - Minor changes to error handling.
  - This adds better support for Addnode (issue #369).
  - Now it skips cluster validation för add node (issue #442).
  - Now it ignores parameters that are not allowed for action Addnode (issue #441).
  - Added support for vNext CTP 1.4 (issue #472).
- Added new resource
  - xSQLServerAlwaysOnAvailabilityGroupReplica
- Changes to xSQLServerDatabaseRecoveryModel
  - Fixed code style, removed SQLServerDatabaseRecoveryModel functions from xSQLServerHelper.
- Changes to xSQLServerAlwaysOnAvailabilityGroup
  - Fixed the permissions check loop so that it exits the loop after the function
    determines the required permissions are in place.
- Changes to xSQLServerAvailabilityGroupListener
  - Removed the dependency of SQLPS provider (issue #460).
  - Cleaned up code.
  - Added test for more coverage.
  - Fixed PSSA rule warnings (issue #255).
  - Parameter Ensure now defaults to 'Present' (issue #450).
- Changes to xSQLServerFirewall
  - Now it will correctly create rules when the resource is used for two or more
    instances on the same server (issue #461).
- Changes to xSQLServerEndpointPermission
  - Added description to the README.md
  - Cleaned up code (issue #257 and issue #231)
  - Now the default value for Ensure is 'Present'.
  - Removed dependency of SQLPS provider (issue #483).
  - Refactored tests so they use less code.
- Changes to README.md
  - Adding deprecated tag to xSQLServerFailoverClusterSetup, xSQLAOGroupEnsure and
    xSQLAOGroupJoin in README.md so it it more clear that these resources has been
    replaced by xSQLServerSetup, xSQLServerAlwaysOnAvailabilityGroup and
    xSQLServerAlwaysOnAvailabilityGroupReplica respectively.
- Changes to xSQLServerEndpoint
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Now SQLInstanceName is mandatory, and is a key, so
    SQLInstanceName has no longer a default value (issue #279).
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Parameter AuthorizedUser has been removed (issue #466,
    issue #275 and issue #80). Connect permissions can be set using the resource
    xSQLServerEndpointPermission.
  - Optional parameter IpAddress has been added. Default is to listen on any
    valid IP-address. (issue #232)
  - Parameter Port now has a default value of 5022.
  - Parameter Ensure now defaults to 'Present'.
  - Resource now supports changing IP address and changing port.
  - Added unit tests (issue #289)
  - Added examples.
- Changes to xSQLServerEndpointState
  - Cleaned up code, removed SupportsShouldProcess and fixed PSSA rules warnings
    (issue #258 and issue #230).
  - Now the default value for the parameter State is 'Started'.
  - Updated README.md with a description for the resources and revised the
    parameter descriptions.
  - Removed dependency of SQLPS provider (issue #481).
  - The parameter NodeName is no longer mandatory and has now the default value
    of $env:COMPUTERNAME.
  - The parameter Name is now a key so it is now possible to change the state on
    more than one endpoint on the same instance. _Note: The resource still only
    supports Database Mirror endpoints at this time._
- Changes to xSQLServerHelper module
  - Removing helper function Get-SQLAlwaysOnEndpoint because there is no resource
    using it any longer.
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Changed helper function Import-SQLPSModule to support SqlServer
    module (issue #91). The SqlServer module is the preferred module so if it is
    found it will be used, and if not found an attempt will be done to load SQLPS
    module instead.
- Changes to xSQLServerScript
  - Updated tests for this resource, because they failed when Import-SQLPSModule
    was updated.

## 6.0.0.0

- Changes to xSQLServerConfiguration
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The parameter SQLInstanceName is now mandatory.
  - Resource can now be used to define the configuration of two or more different
    DB instances on the same server.
- Changes to xSQLServerRole
  - xSQLServerRole now correctly reports that the desired state is present when
    the login is already a member of the server roles.
- Added new resources
  - xSQLServerAlwaysOnAvailabilityGroup
- Changes to xSQLServerSetup
  - Properly checks for use of SQLSysAdminAccounts parameter in $PSBoundParameters.
    The test now also properly evaluates the setup argument for SQLSysAdminAccounts.
  - xSQLServerSetup should now function correctly for the InstallFailoverCluster
    action, and also supports cluster shared volumes. Note that the AddNode action
    is not currently working.
  - It now detects that feature Client Connectivity Tools (CONN) and Client
    Connectivity Backwards Compatibility Tools (BC) is installed.
  - Now it can correctly determine the right cluster when only parameter
    InstallSQLDataDir is assigned a path (issue #401).
  - Now the only mandatory path parameter is InstallSQLDataDir when installing
    Database Engine (issue #400).
  - It now can handle mandatory parameters, and are not using wildcard to find
    the variables containing paths (issue #394).
  - Changed so that instead of connection to localhost it is using $env:COMPUTERNAME
    as the host name to which it connects. And for cluster installation it uses
    the parameter FailoverClusterNetworkName as the host name to which it connects
    (issue #407).
  - When called with Action = 'PrepareFailoverCluster', the SQLSysAdminAccounts
    and FailoverClusterGroup parameters are no longer passed to the setup process
    (issues #410 and 411).
  - Solved the problem that InstanceDir and InstallSQLDataDir could not be set to
    just a qualifier, i.e 'E:' (issue #418). All paths (except SourcePath) can now
    be set to just the qualifier.
- Enables CodeCov.io code coverage reporting.
- Added badge for CodeCov.io to README.md.

    DynamicAlloc parameter is no longer mandatory
- Changes to xSQLServerDatabase
  - When the system is not in desired state the Test-TargetResource will now output
    verbose messages saying so.
- Changes to xSQLServerDatabaseOwner
  - Fixed code style, added updated parameter descriptions to schema.mof and README.md.

## 5.0.0.0

- Improvements how tests are initiated in AppVeyor
  - Removed previous workaround (issue #201) from unit tests.
  - Changes in appveyor.yml so that SQL modules are removed before common test is
    run.
  - Now the deploy step are no longer failing when merging code into Dev. Neither
