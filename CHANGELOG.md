# Change log for xSQLServer

## Unreleased

## 6.0.0.0

- Changes to xSQLServerConfiguration
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The parameter SQLInstanceName is now mandatory.
  - Resource can now be used to define the configuration of two or more different DB instances on the same server.
- Changes to xSQLServerRole
  - xSQLServerRole now correctly reports that the desired state is present when the login is already a member of the server roles.
- Added new resources
  - xSQLServerAlwaysOnAvailabilityGroup
- Changes to xSQLServerSetup
  - Properly checks for use of SQLSysAdminAccounts parameter in $PSBoundParameters. The test now also properly evaluates the setup argument for SQLSysAdminAccounts.
  - xSQLServerSetup should now function correctly for the InstallFailoverCluster action, and also supports cluster shared volumes. Note that the AddNode action is not currently working.
  - It now detects that feature Client Connectivity Tools (CONN) and Client Connectivity Backwards Compatibility Tools (BC) is installed.
  - Now it can correctly determine the right cluster when only parameter InstallSQLDataDir is assigned a path (issue #401).
  - Now the only mandatory path parameter is InstallSQLDataDir when installing Database Engine (issue #400).
  - It now can handle mandatory parameters, and are not using wildcards to find the variables containing paths (issue #394).
  - Changed so that instead of connection to localhost it is using $env:COMPUTERNAME as the host name to which it connects. And for cluster installation it uses the parameter FailoverClusterNetworkName as the host name to which it connects (issue #407).
  - When called with Action = 'PrepareFailoverCluster', the SQLSysAdminAccounts and FailoverClusterGroup parameters are no longer passed to the setup process (issues #410 and 411).
  - Solved the problem that InstanceDir and InstallSQLDataDir could not be set to just a qualifier, i.e 'E:' (issue #418). All paths (except SourcePath) can now be set to just the qualifier.
- Enables CodeCov.io code coverage reporting.
- Added badge for CodeCov.io to README.md.
