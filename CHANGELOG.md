# Change log for SqlServerDsc

The format is based on and uses the types of changes according to [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- SqlServerDsc
  - Added build tasks to generate Wiki documentation for public commands.

### Fixed

- SqlServerDsc
  - `Get-SMOModuleCalculatedVersion`
    - Return SQLPS version as 12.0 instead of 120
  - `Get-SqlDscPreferredModule`
    - Fix sort to get the latest version
  - Public commands no handles when both `-Force` and `-Confirm $true`
    would be passed to command.
  - Enabled NUnit results for HQRM tests.
- `Assert-Feature`
  - Fixed unit tests.
- SqlAGReplica
  - Fix unit test FailedRemoveAvailabilityGroupReplica
- SqlAgentOperator
  - Integration test for changing e-mail address on an existing operator.

### Changed

- SqlServer
  - Updated pipeline files to support pre-releases with ModuleFast (when
    resolving dependencies).
- SqlAG
  - Converted unit test to Pester 5
  - DtcSupportEnabled option in Set-TargetResource and TestTargetResource
- SqlServerDsc
  - Bump PSResourceGet to v1.0.0 (used when resolving dependencies).
  - Update markdown highlights with newly supported keywords.
  - Bump GitHub Action _Stale_ to v9.
  - Bump GitHub Action _CodeQL-Action_ to v3.
  - Documentation is now built using a separate meta task `docs`.
    It is run with the meta task `pack` which is run by the pipeline.
    To run the meta task `docs` the SMO assemblies must be loaded into the
    session, either by importing SqlServer module or loading SMO stubs.
  - QA test improved to speed up quality testing.
- SqlSetup
  - Updated integration tests to use PSResourceGet to download required modules.

## [16.5.0] - 2023-10-05

### Fixed

- SqlDatabase
  - Add Version160 to CompatibilityLevel ValidateSet

### Added

- SqlServerDsc
  - Updated pipeline files to support ModuleFast and PSResourceGet.
  - `Get-SqlDscPreferredModule`
    - Optionally specify what version of the the SQL preferred module to
      be imported using the SMODefaultModuleVersion environment variable
      ([issue #1965](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1965)).
  - Now package the Wiki content and adds it as a GitHub Release asset so it
    is simpler to get the documentation for a specific version.
  - CODEOWNERS file was added to support automatically set reviewer.
- New private command:
  - Get-SMOModuleCalculatedVersion - Returns the version of the SMO module
    as a string. SQLPS version 120 and 130 do not have the correct version set,
    so the file path is used to calculate the version.
- SqlSetup
  - Added the parameter `SqlVersion` that can be used to set the SQL Server
    version to be installed instead of it looking for version in the setup
    executable of the SQL Server media. This parameter is not allowed for
    the setup action `Upgrade`, if specified it will throw an exception
    ([issue #1946](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1946)).

### Changed

- SqlRs
  - Updated examples to use xPSDesiredStateConfiguration instead of PSDScResources.
  - Updated integration tests to use xPSDesiredStateConfiguration instead of PSDScResources.
- SqlScript
  - Updated examples to use xPSDesiredStateConfiguration instead of PSDScResources.
  - Updated integration tests to use xPSDesiredStateConfiguration instead of PSDScResources.
- SqlScriptQuery
  - Updated examples to use xPSDesiredStateConfiguration instead of PSDScResources.
- SqlSetup
  - Updated examples to use xPSDesiredStateConfiguration instead of PSDScResources.
  - Updated integration tests to use xPSDesiredStateConfiguration instead of PSDScResources.

- SqlRSSetup
  - Updated integration tests to use xPSDesiredStateConfiguration instead of PSDScResources.
- SqlServiceAccount
  - Updated integration tests to use xPSDesiredStateConfiguration instead of PSDScResources.
- SqlWindowsFirewall
  - Updated integration tests to use xPSDesiredStateConfiguration instead of PSDScResources.
- SqlServerDsc
  - `Get-SqlDscPreferredModule`
    - Now returns a PSModuleInfo object instead of just the module name.
  - `Import-SqlDscPreferredModule`
    - Handles PSModuleInfo objects from `Get-SqlDscPreferredModule` instead of strings.
    - Sets -ErrorAction 'Stop' on Get-SqlDscPreferredModule to throw an error if
      no SQL module is found. The script-terminating error is caught and made into
      a statement-terminating error.
  - Bump GitHub Action Checkout to v4.
- SqlAGListener
  - Made the resource cluster aware. When ProcessOnlyOnActiveNode is specified,
    the resource will only determine if a change is needed if the target node
    is the active host of the SQL Server instance ([issue #871](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/871)).

### Changed

- SqlServerDsc
  - Temporary disable integration tests for dbatools.
- SqlAg
  - Added optional parameter `SeedingMode` that will set the SeedingMode for the
    SQL Server 2016 and higher. This parameter can only be used together with the
    module _SqlServer_ installed (tested  v21.0.17099). The parameter will be
    ignored if SQLPS module will be used.
- SqlAgReplica
  - Added optional parameter `SeedingMode` that will set the SeedingMode for the
    SQL Server 2016 and higher ([issue #487](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/487)).
    This parameter can only be used together with the module _SqlServer_ installed

### Added

- New public commands:
  - `Disconnect-SqlDscDatabaseEngine` - Disconnects from a SQL Server instance
    that was previously connected to using `Connect-SqlDscDatabaseEngine`.
  - `Test-SqlDscIsSupportedFeature` - Evaluates if a feature is supported by a specific
    Microsoft SQL Server major version. _This command must be extended with_
    _a full list of when features were added and removed in each major_
    _version to fully work_.
- New private commands:
  - `ConvertTo-RedactedText` - Used to redact sensitive information from
    text that then can be used in console output like verbose messages.
  - `Get-FileVersionInformation` - Returns the version information
    for a file.

  (with some restrictions).
- Gitversion no longer evaluates bumping major version using the word "major".
- Update private commands:
  - `Assert-SetupActionProperties` was changed to throw
    an exception when a feature is not supported (calls `Assert-Feature`).
    The private command is indirectly used by the setup action commands.
  - `Invoke-SetupAction` was changed to expand environment variables that
    is passed as the media path.
- SqlSetup
  - Update to support checking non-supported features using the command
    `SqlDscIsSupportedFeature` ([issue #1872](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1872)).
- Update SqlServerDsc.Common Module:
  - `Connect-SQL` - Function will now wait for the SMO Status property to be
    'Online' or throw an exception if time exceeds the statement timeout.
- SqlRS
  - Now uses the command `Invoke-SqlDscQuery` instead of `Invoke-SqlCmd`
   ([issue #1917](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1917)).
  - The parameter `Encrypt` has changed so that `Mandatory` or `Strict`
    will turn on encryption when connecting to the database instance.
- SqlDatabaseMail
  - Update integration tests to verify multiple instances of SqlDatabaseMail
    in the same configuration ([issue #1871](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1871)).
  - Changed comparison logic to use `Compare-DscParameterState` ([issue #1871](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1871)).

  - Correctly outputs query in verbose message when parameter `RedactText`
    is not passed.
- `Import-SqlDscPreferredModule`
  - Better handle preferred module and re-uses logic in `Get-SqlDscPreferredModule`.

## [16.2.0] - 2023-04-10

### Added

- SqlServerDsc
  - New GitHub Actions workflow that run PSScriptAnalyzer for PRs so any
    issues are shown directly in the PR's changed files ([issue #1860](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1860)).
  - Added a separate integration test jobs for SQL Server Reporting Services
    to be able to test configuring SQL Server Reportings Services using
    other values that the default values.
  - Now updates GitHub Actions automatically by allowing dependabot sending
    in pull requests.
  - New public command:
    - `Get-SqlDscPreferredModule` - Returns the name of the first available
      preferred module ([issue #1879](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1879)).
      - Re-using the command `Get-PSModulePath` from the module DscResource.Common.
- SqlSecureConnection
  - Added new parameter `ServerName` that will be used as the host name when
    restarting the SQL Server instance. The specified value should be the same
    name that is used in the certificate ([issue #1888](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1888)).
- SqlSetup
  - Added new parameter `ServerName` that will be used as the host name when
    evaluating the SQL Server instance. If using a secure connection the
    specified value should be the same name that is used in the certificate
    ([issue #1893](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1893)).

### Changed

- SqlServerDsc
  - Update `appveyor.yml` to use `dotnet tool install` to install _GitVersion_.
  - Re-enable integration tests for SqlRSSetup and SqlRS when running against
    SQL Server 2019 ([issue #1847](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1847)).
  - The private function `Import-SQLPSModule` was replaced throughout with
    the public command `Import-SqlDscPreferredModule` ([issue #1848](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1848)).
  - Removed the regular expression `features?` from the GitVersion configuration.
    Before, if a fix commit mentioned the word feature but means a SQL Server
    feature GitVersion would bump minor instead of patch number.
  - Update pipeline script that is used to resolve dependencies.
  - When running in Azure Pipelines any existing SqlServer module is removed
    before running integration tests, so the tests can update to latest version.
  - Now the new label 'command proposal' is an exempt for labeling issues stale.
  - Update the initializing header for all integration test to be equal to
    the unit tests.
  - Rename task jobs in Azure Pipelines ([issue #1881](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1881)).
  - Bump SqlServer version to 22.0.59 for integration tests for SQL Server 2022.
- `Get-SqlDscAudit`
  - The parameter `Name` is no longer mandatory. When left out all the current
    audits are returned ([issue #1812](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1812)).
- `Import-SqlDscPreferredModule`
  - Now correctly preserves paths that is set in the session for the environment
    variable `$env:PSModulePath`. If the module _SqlServer_ or _SQLPS_ are not
    found the command will populate the `$env:PSModulePath` with the
    unique paths from all targets; session, user, and machine. This is done
    so that any new path that was added to the machine or user target will
    also be set in the session.
  - Now imports the preferred module into the global scope so that MOF-based
    resources (that is in another module scope) can use the imported module.
  - Some code cleanup ([issue #1881](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1881)).
  - Refactor to re-use the command `Get-SqlDscPreferredModule`.
- SqlServerDsc.Common
  - `Restart-SqlService` no longer silently ignores errors that prevents
     the instance to go online. If the instance has not gone online during
     the timeout period the error thrown will no contain the last error
     reported by `Connect-SQL` ([issue #1891](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1891)).
  - `Invoke-SqlScript` no longer passes the parameter `Variable` to
    `Invoke-SqlCmd` if it is not set ([issue #1896](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1896)).
- `DatabasePermission`
  - Class was updated with the latest database permissions.

### Fixed

- `Assert-SetupActionProperties`
  - Now throws an exception if the setup action is `Install` and the feature
    analysis services is specified without the parameter `ASSysAdminAccounts`
    ([issue #1845](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1845)).
  - Now throws an exception if the setup action is `Install` and the feature
    database engine is specified without the parameter `SqlSysAdminAccounts`.
- `Invoke-SetupAction`
  - The parameter `SqlSysAdminAccounts` is no longer mandatory to allow
    installation where the database engine is not installed.
- `Install-SqlDscServer`
  - The parameter `SqlSysAdminAccounts` is no longer mandatory to allow
    installation where the database engine is not installed.
- `SqlRS`
  - Fixed issue of configuring reporting services ([issue #1868](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1868)).
  - Test renamed to `When Reports virtual directory is different` so it
    is more correct and not a duplicate.
  - Integration tests configuration names was renamed to better tell what
    the configuration does ([issue #1880](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1880)).
- SqlServerDsc.Common
  - The command `Restart-SqlService` was updated to correctly evaluate when
    the timeout value is reached ([issue #1889](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1889)).

    command.
  - Integration tests are now also run on SQL Server 2022 and SQL Server
    Reporting Services 2022.
  - Integration tests now wait for LCM after each It-block, not just at the
    end of a Context-block. Hopefully this will mitigate some of the intermittent
    errors we have seen when running the integration tests in the pipeline.
  - Use preview version of Pester to support the development of Pester as
    this is a code base with a diverse set of tests thar can help catch
    issues in Pester. If preview release of Pester prevents release we

- SqlDatabase
  - Added compatibility levels for SQL Server 2022 (major version 16).
- SqlSetup
  - Paths for SQL Server 2022 are correctly returned by Get.
- SqlRS
  - Added optional parameter `Encrypt`. Parameter `Encrypt` controls whether
    the connection used by `Invoke-SqlCmd should enforce encryption. This
    parameter can only be used together with the module _SqlServer_ v22.x

    major versions of the module _SqlServer_ is used.
- SqlScript
  - Added optional parameter `Encrypt`. Parameter `Encrypt` controls whether

    the connection used by `Invoke-SqlCmd should enforce encryption. This
    parameter can only be used together with the module _SqlServer_ v22.x
    (minimum v22.0.49-preview). The parameter will be ignored if an older
    major versions of the module _SqlServer_ is used.
- SqlTraceFlag
  - The resource is now tested with an integration tests ([issue #1835](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1835)).
  - A new parameter `ClearAllTraceFlags` was added so a configuration
    can enforce that there should be no trace flags.
- The public commands `Add-SqlDscNode`, `Complete-SqlDscFailoverCluster`,
  `Complete-SqlDscImage`, `Install-SqlDscServer`, and `Repair-SqlDscServer`
  now support the setup argument `ProductCoveredBySA` ([issue #1798](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1798)).

### Changed

- SqlServerDsc
  - Update Stale GitHub Action to v7.
  - Update to build module in separate folder under `output`.
  - Moved the build step of the pipeline to a Windows build worker when
    running in Azure DevOps.
  - Class-based resources now uses the parent class `ResourceBase` from the
    module _DscResource.Base_ ([issue #1790](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1790)).
  - Settings for the _Visual Studio Code_ extension _Pester Tests_ was changed
    to be able to run all unit tests, and all tests run by the extension
    are now run in a separate process to be able to handle changes in
    class-based resources.
  - The AppVeyor configuration file was updated to include the possibility
    to run integration tests for SQL Server 2022.
  - The AppVeyor configuration file was updated to include the possibility
    to run skip installing one or more SQL Server instances when debugging
    in AppVeyor to help maximize the time alloted be run.
  - The stubs in `SqlServerStub.psm1` are now based on the commands from the
    module SqlServer v22.0.49-preview.
  - The module will now call `Import-SqlDscPreferredModule` when the module
    is imported to make sure SqlServer (default preferred module) or SQLPS
    is loaded into the session. This will make it possible for classes and
    commands to use and return SQL types. If no module is found it will
    output a warning to install any of the dependent modules.
  - Add empty constructor to classes to be able to use Pester's new code
    coverage method. See more information can be found in [pester/Pester#2306](https://github.com/pester/Pester/issues/2306).
  - The type of the property `Reasons` was changed in the class-based resources.
    This resolves a problem when using two DSC resource modules that was
    using the same class-type for the property `Reasons`. Resolves the issues
    [issue #1831](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1831),
    [issue #1832](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1832),
    and [issue #1833](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1833).

    for all AvailabilityReplica changes.
- Private function `Invoke-SetupAction` ([issue #1798](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1798)).
  - Was changed to support the SQL Server 2022 GA feature `AzureExtension`
    (that replaced the feature name `ARC`).
  - Support the setup argument `ProductCoveredBySA`.
  - No longer supports the argument `OnBoardSQLToARC` as it was removed in
    SQL Server 2022 GA.
- `Install-SqlDscServer`
  - Was changed to support the SQL Server 2022 GA feature `AzureExtension`
    (that replaced the feature name `ARC`) ([issue #1798](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1798)).
- `Uninstall-SqlDscServer`
  - Was changed to support the SQL Server 2022 GA feature `AzureExtension`
    (that replaced the feature name `ARC`) ([issue #1798](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1798)).
  - Now support the argument `SuppressPrivacyStatementNotice` ([issue #1809](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1809)).
- `Import-SqlDscPreferredModule`
  - No longer tries to get the environment variables from the machine state
    when run on Linux or macOS. This will allow the unit tests to run
    cross-plattform.
- SqlReplication
  - The resource now supports SQL Server 2022. The resource will require
    the module _SqlServer_ v22.0.49-preview or newer when used against an
    SQL Server 2022 instance ([issue #1801](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1801)).
- SqlProtocol
  - The resource now supports SQL Server 2022. The resource will require
    the module _SqlServer_ v22.0.49-preview or newer when used against an
    SQL Server 2022 instance ([issue #1802](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1802)).
- SqlProtocolTcpIp
  - The resource now supports SQL Server 2022. The resource will require
    the module _SqlServer_ v22.0.49-preview or newer when used against an
    SQL Server 2022 instance ([issue #1805](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1805)).
- SqlServiceAccount
  - The resource now supports SQL Server 2022. The resource will require
    the module _SqlServer_ v22.0.49-preview or newer when used against an
    SQL Server 2022 instance ([issue #1800](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1800)).
- SqlSetup
  - Integration tests now used _SqlServer_ module version 22.0.49-preview
    when running against _SQL Server 2022_, when testing _SQL Server 2016_,
    _SQL Server 2017_, and _SQL Server 2019_ the module version 21.1.18256
    is used.
  - Integration tests now supports installing preview versions of the module
    _SqlServer_.
- SqlServerDsc.Common
  - `Import-SQLPSModule`
    - Small changed to the localized string verbose message when the preferred
      module (_SqlServer_) is not found.
  - `Invoke-SqlScript`
    - Added the optional parameter `Encrypt` which controls whether the connection
      used by `Invoke-SqlCmd` should enforce encryption. This parameter can
      only be used together with the module _SqlServer_ v22.x (minimum
      v22.0.49-preview). The parameter will be ignored if an older major
      versions of the module _SqlServer_ is used.
  - `Connect-SQL`
    - Was updated to handle both `-ErrorAction 'Stop'` and `-ErrorAction 'SilentlyContinue'`
      when passed to the command ([issue #1837](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1837)).
    - Now returns a more clear error message when the status of a database
      instance is not `Online`.
  - `Import-SQLPSModule`
    - The function was changed to call public command `Import-SqlDscPreferredModule`.
- SqlTraceFlag
  - The examples was updated to show that values should be passed as an array,
    even when there is only one value.
  - `Get-TargetResource` was updated to always return an array for parameter
    `TraceFlags`, `TraceFlagsToInclude`, and `TraceFlagsToInclude`. _The last_
    _two properties will always return an empty array._

### Fixed

- SqlServerDsc
  - Localized strings file `en-US/SqlServerDsc.strings.psd1` no longer
    referencing the wrong module in a comment.
- SqlAGReplica
  - No longer tries to enforce EndpointHostName when it is not part of the
    configuration ([issue #1821](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1821)).
  - Now `Get-TargetResource` always returns values for the properties `Name`
    and `AvailabilityGroupName` ([issue #1822](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1822)).
  - Now `Test-TargetResource` no longer test properties that cannot
    be enforced ([issue #1822](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1822)).
- SqlTraceFlag
  - `Set-TargetResource` was updated to handle a single trace flag in the
    current state ([issue #1834](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1834)).
  - `Set-TargetResource` was updated to correctly include or exclude a single
    flag ([issue #1834](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1834)).
- SqlAudit
  - Return the correct type for parameter `LogType` when calling method `Get()`.

- CommonTestHelper
  - `Import-SqlModuleStub`
    - Added the optional parameter **PasThru** that, if used, will return the
      name of the stub module.
    - When removing stub modules from the session that is not supposed to
      be loaded, it uses `Get-Module -All` to look for previously loaded
      stub modules.
  - `Remove-SqlModuleStub`
    - Added a new helper function `Remove-SqlModuleStub` for tests to remove
      the PowerShell SqlServer stub module when a test has run.
- SqlWindowsFirewall

### Changed

- SqlServerDsc
  - Updated pipeline to use the build worker image 'ubuntu-latest'.
  - Switch to installing GitVersion using 'dotnet tool install' ([issue #1732](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1732)).
  - Bumped Stale task to v5 in the GitHub workflow.
  - Make it possible to publish code coverage on failed test runs, and
    when re-run a fail job.
  - Exclude Script Analyzer rule **TypeNotFound** in the file `.vscode/analyzersettings.psd1`.
  - Update CONTRIBUTING.md describing error handling in commands and class-based
    resources.
  - The QA tests are now run in Windows PowerShell due to a bug in PowerShell 7
    that makes class-based resource using inheritance to not work.
  - The QA test are excluding the rule **TypeNotFound** because it cannot
    run on the source files (there is a new issue that is tracking so this
    rule is only run on the built module).
  - The Pester code coverage has been switched to use the older functionality
    that uses breakpoints to calculate coverage. Newer functionality sometimes
    throw an exception when used in conjunction with class-based resources.¨
  - SMO stubs (used in the unit tests)
    - Was updated to remove a bug related to the type `DatabasePermissionInfo`
      when used with the type `DatabasePermissionSet`.
      The stubs suggested that the property `PermissionType` (of type `DatabasePermissionSet`)
      in `DatabasePermissionInfo` should have been a array `DatabasePermissionSet[]`.
      This conflicted with real SMO as it does not pass an array, but instead
      a single `DatabasePermissionSet`. The stubs was modified to mimic the
      real SMO. At the same time some old mock code in the SMO stubs was removed
      as it was no longer in use.
    - Was updated to remove a bug related to the type `ServerPermissionInfo`
      when used with the type `ServerPermissionSet`. The stubs suggested that
      the property `PermissionType` (of type `ServerPermissionSet`)
      in `ServerPermissionInfo` should have been a array `ServerPermissionSet[]`.
      This conflicted with real SMO as it does not pass an array, but instead
      a single `ServerPermissionSet`. The stubs was modified to mimic the
      real SMO. At the same time some old mock code in the SMO stubs was removed
      as it was no longer in use.
  - Updated integration tests README.md to describe how to use Appveyor to
    debug integration tests.
- Wiki
  - add introduction and links to DSC technology
- SqlServerDsc.Common
  - The parameter `SetupCredential` of the function `Connect-SQL` was renamed
    to `Credential` and the parameter name `SetupCredential` was made a
    parameter alias.
- SqlLogin
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The parameters `LoginMustChangePassword`, `LoginPasswordExpirationEnabled`,
    and `LoginPasswordPolicyEnforced` no longer have a default value of `$true`.
    This means that when creating a new login, and not specifically setting
    these parameters to `$true` in the configuration, the login that is created
    will have these properties set to `$false`.
  - BREAKING CHANGE: `LoginMustChangePassword`, `LoginPasswordExpirationEnabled`,
    and `LoginPasswordPolicyEnforced` parameters no longer enforce default
    values ([issue #1669](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1669)).
- SqlServerDsc
  - All tests have been converted to run in Pester 5 (Pester 4 can no
    longer be supported) ([issue #1654](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1654)).
  - Pipeline build and deploy now runs on Ubuntu 18.04, see more information
    in https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/issues/3287.
  - Update the pipeline file _azure-pipelines.yml_ to use the latest version
    from the Sampler project.
- SqlRs
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Now the Reporting Services is always restarted after
    the call to CIM method `SetDatabaseConnection` when setting up the
    Reporting Services. This so to try to finish the initialization of
    Reporting Services. This was prior only done for _SQL Server Reporting_
    _Services 2019_ ([issue #1721](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1721)).
  - Added some verbose messages to better indicate which CIM methods are run
    and when they are run.
  - Minor refactor to support running unit test with strict mode enabled.
- SqlLogin
  - Only enforces optional parameter `LoginType` when it is specified in the
    configuration.
  - Only enforces optional parameters `LoginPasswordExpirationEnabled` and
    `LoginPasswordPolicyEnforced` for a SQL login when the parameters are
    specified in the configuration.
  - A localized string for an error message was updated to correctly reflect
    the code that says that to use a SQL login the authentication mode must
    be either Mixed or Normal, prio it just stated Mixed.
- SqlSecureConnection
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Now `Get-TargetResource` returns the value `'Empty'`
    for the property thumbprint if there is no thumbprint set in the current
    state. Returning the value `'Empty'` was always intended, but it due to
    a bug it was never returned, but instead it returned an empty string
    or `$null` value.
- SqlWindowsFirewall
  - Now the property Features always return the features in the order
    'SQLENGINE', 'RS', 'AS', and 'IS' if they are installed.
- SqlAGListener
  - Removed unnecessary exception that is very unlikely to be thrown in
    `Set-TargetResource` and `Test-TargetResource`.
  - Simplified the logic that checks if the properties are in desired state
    as the new unit tests did not pass with the previous logic.
  - Updated the verbose message when the listener does not exist to write
    out the name of the listener that is meant to be updated, added, or
    dropped.
  - Only update values for the properties that are actually enforced by the
    configuration.
- SqlAGDatabase
  - Added StatementTimeout optional parameter with default value of 600 seconds
    (10 mins) to SqlAGDatabase to fix issue #1743. Users will be able to specify
    the backup and restore timeout with it.
- SqlDatabaseUser
  - `Test-TargetResource` returns true if the `IsUpdateable` property of the
    database is `$false` to resolve issue #1748.
- SqlDatabaseRole
  - `Test-TargetResource` returns true if the `IsUpdateable` property of the
    database is `$false` to resolve issue #1750.
- SqlAlwaysOnService
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The parameter `IsHadrEnabled` is no longer returned by
    `Get-TargetResource`. The `Ensure` parameter now returns `Present` if
    Always On High Availability Diaster Recovery is enabled and `Absent`
    if it is disabled.
- SqlDatabasePermission
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The resource has been refactored. The parameters
    `ParameterState` and `Permissions` has been replaced by parameters
    `Permission`, `PermissionToInclude`, and `PermissionToExclude`. These
    permissions parameters are now an instance of the type `DatabasePermission`.
    The type `DatabasePermission` contains two properties; `State` and
    `Permission`. This fixes issue [issue #1555](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1555).
  - The resource was refactored into a class-based resource.
  - Made the resource derive from `SqlResourceBase` to clean up the code
    a bit.
- SqlPermission
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The resource has been refactored. The parameters
    `Permissions` has been replaced by parameters `Permission`,
    `PermissionToInclude`, and `PermissionToExclude`. These permissions
    parameters are now an instance of the type `ServerPermission`.
    The type `ServerPermission` contains two properties; `State` and
    `Permission`. This closes the issue [issue #1761](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1761),
    it also fixes the issues [issue #1773](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1773),
    [issue #1704](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1704),
    and [issue #752](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/752).
  - The resource was refactored into a class-based resource.
  - Made the resource derive from `SqlResourceBase` to clean up the code
    a bit.
- Class `ResourceBase`
  - Renamed the hidden property that derived classes can specify which properties
    to not enforce when comparing desired state against current state. New name
    of the hidden property is `ExcludeDscProperties`.
- SqlAudit
  - Fix documentation that contain minor style errors.

### Fixed

- SqlServerDsc
  - URLs the referenced TechNet in the documentation has been update to link to
    new pages at docs.microsoft.com.
  - Fix pipeline so code coverage is published on fail.
  - Remove duplicate deploy step (already present in `azure-pipelines.yml`).
- CommonTestHelper
  - The test helper function `Import-SqlModuleStub` was using wrong casing for
    one of the stub  modules which failed test when running cross plattform.
- SqlDatabaseObjectPermission
  - Fix for issue ([issue #1724](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1724)).
    - BREAKING CHANGE: Updated class DSC_DatabaseObjectPermission.
      - Changed Permission from an array to a string.
      - Updated Permission to a key property.
      - Updated Integration Tests to test permission grants on multiple objects.
- SqlProtocolTcpIp
  - Output verbose information in integration tests so it is shown what NICs
    are available and what IP address the tests will use.
- SqlAlias
  - Now the code passes strict mode during unit testing.
  - When an existing alias existed with a static TCP port but the desired
    state was to have a dynamic port, the function `Test-TargetResource` did
    not correctly return `$false`. Same for an alias that existed with a
    dynamic port but the desired state was to have a static port. Now the
    function `Test-TargetResource` returns `$false` in both these scenarios.
- SqlAgentOperator
  - In a certain case the `Test-TargetResource` function returned the wrong
    verbose message. If passing an e-mail address and the operator did not
    exist it would wrongly say operator exist but had wrong e-mail address.
    Truth was that the operator did not exist at all.
- SqlDatabaseMail
  - Improved the verification of an empty description so that it can handle
    both empty string and `$null`.
- SqlDatabaseRole
  - Some variables where not initialized correctly which was discovered when
    running the unit tests using strict mode. Now the variables are initialized
    and should not cause any issues in the object returned from the function
    `Get-TargetResource`.
- SqlEndpointPermission
  - Verbose messages did not use the correct variable name, so the messages
    did not contain the correct information.
  - Minor style guideline changes.
- SqlMaxDop
  - The function `Get-TargetResource` did not initialize some of the variables
    correctly which was discovered when running the unit tests using strict
    mode.
  - The function `Test-TargetResource` did not correctly evaluate if the
    node was the active node..
- SqlMemory
  - Now it possible to just set the minimum memory without it throwing because
    the maximum memory is not specified.
  - In a certain scenario the maximum memory would be enforced even if it was
    not specified in the configuration.
- SqlWindowsFirewall
  - Now the variables in `Get-TargetResource` are correctly initialized so
    they pass the new unit test that use strict mode.
  - The verbose message in `Test-TargetResource` did not use the correct
    variable name, so the message did not contain the correct information.
  - Removed unnecessary logic in `Set-TargetResource` that did just evaluated
    the same thing that the call to function `Get-TargetResource` already
    does.
- SqlSetup
  - Now the variables in `Set-TargetResource` are correctly initialized so
    they pass the new unit test that use strict mode.
  - Some verbose messages in `Get-TargetResource` wrongly reference a variable
    that was not available.
  - The loop that evaluates what features are installed did an unnecessary
    step for each iteration. A line of code was moved outside of the loop.
  - The `SourcePath` parameter is now mandatory for all `*-TargetResource`
    ([issue #1755](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1755)).
- SqlDatabasePermission
  - It is no longer possible to have one permission that has two different
    states in the same configuration, e.g. denying and granting `update`
    in the same configuration.
  - Fixed comment-based help and cleaned up comments.
  - Fix localized string that referenced 'user' instead of 'principal',
    and correct localized string ID for each string.
  - Fix comment-based help.
- SqlPermission
  - Fix comment-based help.
- `Set-SqlDscDatabasePermission`
  - Minor code cleanup.
- `ConvertTo-Reason`
  - Fix to handle `$null` values on Windows PowerShell.
  - If the property name contain the word 'Path' the value will be parsed to
    replace backslash or slashes at the end of the string, e.g. `'/myPath/'`
    will become `'/myPath'`.
- `ResourceBase`
  - Now handles `Ensure` correctly from derived `GetCurrentState()`. But
    requires that the `GetCurrentState()` only return key property if object
    is present, and does not return key property if object is absent.
    Optionally the resource's derived `GetCurrentState()` can handle `Ensure`
    itself.

## [15.2.0] - 2021-09-01

### Changed

- SqlServerDsc
  - Changed to the new GitHub deploy tasks that is required for the latest
    version of the Sampler module.
  - Updated pipeline configuration to align with the latest changes in [Sampler](https://github.com/gaelcolas/Sampler).
  - Update codecov.yml to support carry forward flags.
  - Updated pipelines files to latest from Sampler project.
  - Updated GitHub issue templates.
  - Remove pipeline jobs `Test_Integration_SQL2016`, `Test_Integration_SQL2017`,
    and `Test_Integration_SQL2019` and replaced with a single job
    `Test_Integration` ([issue #1713](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1713)).
  - Update HQRM tests to run on the VM image `windows-2022`.
  - Update unit tests to run on the VM image `windows-2022`.
  - Update integration tests to run both on Windows Server 2019 and Windows
    Server 2022 ([issue #1713](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1713)).
  - Switched to a new Linux build worker for the pipeline ([issue #1729](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1729)).
- SqlSetup
  - The helper function `Connect-SqlAnalysis` was using `LoadWithPartial()`
    to load the assembly _Microsoft.AnalysisServices_. On a node where multiple
    instances with different versions of SQL Server (regardless of features)
    is installed, this will result in the first assembly found in the
    GAC will be loaded into the session, not taking versions into account.
    This can result in an assembly version being loaded that is not compatible
    with the version of SQL Server it was meant to be used with.
    A new method of loading the assembly _Microsoft.AnalysisServices_ was
    introduced under a feature flag; `'AnalysisServicesConnection'`.
    This new functionality depends on the [SqlServer](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/SqlServer)
    module, and must be present on the node. The [SqlServer](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/SqlServer)
    module can be installed on the node by leveraging the new DSC resource
    `PSModule` in the [PowerShellGet](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PowerShellGet/2.1.2)
    module (v2.1.2 and higher). This new method does not work with the
    SQLPS module due to the SQLPS module does not load the correct assembly,
    while [SqlServer](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/SqlServer)
    module (v21.1.18080 and above) does. The new functionality is used
    when the parameter `FeatureFlag` is set to `'AnalysisServicesConnection'`.
    This functionality will be the default in a future breaking release.
  - Under a feature flag `'AnalysisServicesConnection'`. The detection of
    a successful connection to the SQL Server Analysis Services has also been
    changed. Now it actually evaluates the property `Connected` of the returned
    `Microsoft.AnalysisServices.Server` object. The new functionality is used
    when the parameter `FeatureFlag` is set to `'AnalysisServicesConnection'`.
    This functionality will be the default in a future breaking release.
- SqlAgentAlert
  - Switched README file with SqlAgentFailsafe ([issue #1709](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1397)).
- SqlAgentFailsafe
  - Switched README file with SqlAgentAlert ([issue #1709](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1397)).

### Added

- SqlMemory
  - Added two new optional parameters MinMemoryPercent and MaxMemoryPercent.
    Provides the ability to set the minimum and/or maximum buffer pool used by
    the SQL Server instance as a percentage of total server memory.
    ([issue #1397](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1397)).
- SqlRSSetup
  - Integration tests now install _Microsoft SQL Server 2019 Reporting Services_
    ([issue #1717](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1717)).
- SqlRS
  - Integration tests now configures _Microsoft SQL Server 2019 Reporting Services_.

### Fixed

- SqlSetup
  - Fixed integration tests for SQL Server 2016 and SQL Server 2017.
- SqlServerDsc.Common
  - Fixed so that _CredScan_ no longer reports a password false-positive
    ([issue #1712](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1712)).
- SqlRS
  - Fixed SSRS 2019 initialization ([issue #1509](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1509)).
  - Fix a problem that did not correctly evaluate the `UseSSL` property against
    the current state.

## [15.1.1] - 2021-02-12

### Fixed

- SqlTraceFlag
  - Fixed `$null` reference error when no actual trace flags are present.
    Added two arrays to prevent a `$null` reference at compare-object
    ([issue #1688](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1688)).
- SqlServerDsc
  - Removed a left-over comment in the file `analyzersettings.psd1`.

## [15.1.0] - 2021-02-02

### Added

- SqlServerDsc
  - Added a new script analyzer rule to verify that `Import-SQLPSModule` or `Connect-SQL`
    (that implicitly calls `Import-SQLPSModule`) is present in each `Get-`, `Test-`,
    and `Set-TargetResource` function. If neither command is not needed then the
    analyzer rule should be overridden ([issue #1683](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1683)).
  - Added a new pipeline job that runs Script Analyzer on all PowerShell scripts
    in the source folder. The rules are defined by the Script Analyzer settings
    file `.vscode\analyzersettings.psd1` (which also the Visual Studio Code
    PowerShell extension uses).
  - Added unit tests and integration tests for SQL Server 2019
    ([issue #1310](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1310)).

### Changed

- SqlServerDsc
  - Suppressed new custom Script Analyzer rule `SqlServerDsc.AnalyzerRules\Measure-CommandsNeededToLoadSMO`
    for `Get-`, `Test-`, and `Set-TargetResource` functions in the resources.
- SqlLogin
  - Added functionality to throw exception if an update to the `LoginMustChangePassword`
    value on an existing SQL Login is attempted. This functionality is not supported
    by referenced, SQL Server Management Object (SMO), libraries and cannot be
    supported directly by this module.
  - Added integration tests to ensure that an added (or updated) `SqlLogin` can
    connect into a SQL instance once added (or updated).
  - Added integration tests to ensure that the default database connected to by
    a `SqlLogin` is the same as specified in the resource's `DefaultDatabase`
    property/parameter.
  - Amended how the interdependent, `PasswordExpirationEnabled` and `PasswordPolicyEnforced`
    properties/parameters are updated within the `SqlLogin` resource - Both values
    are now updated together if either one or both are not currently in the desired
    state. This change avoids exceptions thrown by transitions to valid, combinations
    of these properties that have to transition through an invalid combination (e.g.
    where `PasswordExpirationEnabled` is `$true` but `PasswordPolicyEnforced` is
    `$false`).
- SqlSetup
  - Minor refactor due to source code lint errors. The loop what evaluates
    the configuration parameters `*FailoverCluster` was change to a `foreach()`.

### Fixed

- SqlServerDsc
  - The component `gitversion` that is used in the pipeline was wrongly
    configured when the repository moved to the new default branch `main`.
    It no longer throws an error when using newer versions of GitVersion
    ([issue #1674](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1674)).
  - Minor lint errors throughout the repository.
- SqlLogin
  - Added integration tests to assert `LoginPasswordExpirationEnabled`,
  `LoginPasswordPolicyEnforced` and `LoginMustChangePassword` properties/parameters
  are applied and updated correctly. Similar integration tests also added to ensure
  the password of the `SqlLogin` is updated if the password within the `SqlCredential`
  value/object is changed ([issue #361](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/361),
  [issue #1032](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1032) and
  [issue #1050](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1050)).
  - Updated `SqlLogin`, integration tests to make use of amended `Wait-ForIdleLcm`,
    helper function, `-Clear` switch usage to remove intermittent, integration
    test failures ([issue #1634](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1634)).
- SqlRSSetup
  - If parameter `SuppressRestart` is set to `$false` the `/norestart`
    argument is no longer wrongly added ([issue #1401](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1401)).
- SqlSetup
  - Added/corrected `InstallSharedDir`, property output when using SQL Server 2019.
- SqlTraceFlag
  - Fixed Assembly not loaded error ([issue #1680](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1680)).
- SqlDatabaseUser
  - Added parameter `ServerName` to the call of `Assert-SqlLogin`.
    `@PSBoundParameters` doesn't capture the default value of `ServerName`
    when it is not explicitly set by the caller ([issue #1647](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1647)).

## [15.0.1] - 2021-01-09

### Changed

- SqlServerDsc
  - Renamed `master` branch to `main` ([issue #1660](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1660)).
  - The module manifest property `DscResourcesToExport` now updates automatically
    using the pipeline.
  - Removed `Export-ModuleMember` from DSC resource that still had it.
  - The variable `$env:COMPUTERNAME` does not exist cross-platform which
    hinders development and testing on macOS and Linux. Instead the
    resources have been update to use the helper function `Get-ComputerName`
    which returns the current computer name cross-plattform.
  - Switch to GitHub Action Stale instead of GitHub App (Probot) Stale.

### Fixed

- SqlAGDatabase
  - Fix for issue ([issue #1492](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1492))
    added AutomaticSeeding for this resource. In Set-TargetResource added logic
    that looks at all replicas of an availability group. When automatic seeding
    is found, it will use that.
  - Lots of extra tests to check AutomaticSeeding.
  - The parameter `BackupPath` is still needed just in case a database never has
    been backed up before.
  - Fixed a typo.
- SqlMaxDop
  - Fixes ([issue #396](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/396)).
    Added three return values in Get-Target resource.
- SqlProtocol
  - Changed KeepAlive Type from UInt16 to Int32 to reflect the actual WMI.ManagementObject
    Fixes #1645 ([issue #1645](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1645)).
  - The verbose messages now correctly show that `$env:COMPUTERNAME` is used
    to get or set the configuration, while parameter **ServerName** is used
    to restart the instance.
- SqlProtocolTcpIp
  - The verbose messages now correctly show that `$env:COMPUTERNAME` is used
    to get or set the configuration, while parameter **ServerName** is used
    to restart the instance.
- SqlDatabaseMail
  - Now if a non-mandatory property is not part of the configuration it will
    not be enforced ([issue #1661](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1661)).
- SqlSetup
  - When the SqlSetup detects that the expected components was not installed
    and consequently throws an exception, that exception message now presents
    a link to an article on how to find the SQL Server setup logs ([issue #1420](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1420)).
- SqlRSSetup
  - If parameter `EditionUpgrade` is set to `$false` the `/EditionUpgrade`
    argument is no longer wrongly added ([issue #1398](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1398)).
- SqlServerDsc.Common
  - Updated `Get-ServerProtocolObject`, helper function to ensure an exception is
    thrown if the specified instance cannot be obtained ([issue #1628](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1628)).

## [15.0.0] - 2020-12-06

### Added

- SqlServerDsc
  - Added new resource SqlTraceFlag to set or changes TraceFlags on SQL Server.
    This resource is based on @Zuldans code but with SqlServerDsc integrated SMO.
    Credits: https://github.com/Zuldan/cSQLServerTraceFlag
  - Added a lot of test scripts to validated the code.
- SqlEndpoint
  - Added support for the Service Broker Endpoint ([issue #498](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/498)).
- SqlDatabaseRole
  - Added test to ensure Add-SqlDscDatabaseRoleMember throws the expected error
    ([issue #1620](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1620)).

### Changed

- SqlServerDsc
  - Updated code formatting using latest release of PSScriptAnalyzer.
  - The URLs in the CHANGELOG.md that was pointing to issues is now
    referencing the new repository name and URL.
- SqlServerDsc.Common
  - The helper function `Get-SqlInstanceMajorVersion` no longer have a default
    value for parameter **InstanceName** since the parameter is mandatory
    and it was never used.
- SqlReplication
  - The resource are now using the helper function `Get-SqlInstanceMajorVersion`
    ([issue #1408](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1408)).
- SqlRole
  - Major overhaul of resource.
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Removed decision making from get-TargetResource; this
    prevented a simple solution for issue #550. it now just tels if a role
    exists or not. And what members are in that role. MembersToInclude and
    MembersToExclude now always return $null.
  - Added sanitize function (`Get-CorrectedMemberParameters`) to make it
    so for the sysadmin role SA does not get altered ([issue #550](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/550)).
  - Added lots of tests.
- SqlWaitForAG
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Fix for issue ([issue #1569](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1569))
    The resource now waits for the Availability Group to become Available.
  - Two parameters where added to test get and set resource at instance level.
- SqlSetup
  - Minor change to the evaluation of the parameter `BrowserSvcStartupType`,
    if it has an assigned a value or not.

### Fixed

- SqlDatabaseRole
  - Fixed check to see if the role and user existed in the database. The
    previous logic would always indicate the role or user was not found unless
    the role had the same name as the user. Also updated the
    DesiredMembersNotPresent string to be more accurate when an extra user is
    in the role ([issue #1487](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1487)).
- SqlAlwaysOnService
  - Updated Get-TargetResource to return all defined schema properties
    ([issue #150](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1501)).
- SqlSetup
  - Added a note to the documentation that the parameter `BrowserSvcStartupType`
    cannot be used for configurations that utilize the `'InstallFailoverCluster'`
    action ([issue #1627](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1627)).
- SqlDatabaseObjectPermission
  - Updated unit tests to remove errors relating to missing `Where()` method
    ([issue #1648](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1648)).

## [14.2.1] - 2020-08-14

### Changed

- SqlServerDsc
  - Document changes in the file `build.yml`.
  - The regular expression for `major-version-bump-message` in the file
    `GitVersion.yml` was changed to only raise major version when the
    commit message contain the phrase `breaking change`, or when it contain
    the word `breaking` or `major`.
- SqlSetup
  - Duplicate function Get-SqlMajorVersion was removed and instead the
    helper function `Get-FilePathMajorVersion` from the helper module
    SqlServerDsc.Common is used ([issue #1178](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1178)).
- SqlWindowsFirewall
  - Duplicate function Get-SqlMajorVersion was removed and instead the
    helper function `Get-FilePathMajorVersion` from the helper module
    SqlServerDsc.Common is used ([issue #1178](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1178)).
- SqlServerDsc.Common
  - Function `Get-FilePathMajorVersion` was added. The function `Get-SqlMajorVersion`
    from the resources _SqlSetup_ and _SqlWindowsFirewall_ was moved and
    renamed without any functional changes ([issue #1178](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1178)).

### Fixed

- SqlServerDsc
  - Removed helper functions that was moved to the module _DscResource.Common_.
    DSC resources using those functions are using them from the module
    _DscResource.Common_.
- SqlDatabaseObjectPermission
  - Fixed method invocation failed because of missing `Where()` method ([issue #1600](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1600)).
    - New integration tests to verify scenarios when passing a single permission.
  - To enforce a scenario where a permission must be changed from `'GrantWithGrant'`
    to `'Grant'` a new parameter **Force** was added ([issue #1602](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1602)).
    The parameter **Force** is used to enforce the desired state in those
    scenarios where revocations must be performed to enforce the desired
    state, even if that encompasses cascading revocations. If parameter
    **Force** is _not_ set to `$true` an exception is thrown in those
    scenarios where a revocation must be performed to enforce the desired
    state.
    - New integration tests to verify scenarios when current state for a
      permission is `'GrantWithGrant'` but desired state should be `'Grant'`.
- SqlSetup
  - The example `4-InstallNamedInstanceInFailoverClusterFirstNode.ps1` was
    updated to no longer reference the issue #405 and issue #444 in the
    comment-based help. The issues was fixed a while back and _SqlSetup_
    now supports the built-in parameter `PsDscRunAsCredential` ([issue #975](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/975)).

## [14.2.0] - 2020-07-23

### Fixed

- SqlServerDsc
  - Updated comment-based help according to style guideline throughout
    ([issue #1500](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1500)).
  - Using Codecov carry forward flag because we are not sending code coverage
    report on each commit.
- CommonTestHelper
  - Minor style changes.
- SqlSetup
  - Updated the documentation with the currently supported features
    ([issue #1566](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1566)).
  - Update documentation around permissions in directory tree for Analysis Services
    ([issue #1443](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1443)).
  - Documented that on certain operating systems, when using least privilege
    for the service account, the security policy setting _Network access:_
    _Restrict clients allowed to make remote calls to SAM_ can result in
    a access denied error during install of the _SQL Server Database Engine_
    ([issue #1559](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1559)).
- SqlRole
  - Fixed the `ServerName` parameter to work with default value of
    `$env:COMPUTERNAME` ([issue #1592](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1592)).

## [14.1.0] - 2020-07-06

### Removed

- SqlServerDsc
  - Remove the file `.github/CONTRIBUTION.md` as it no longer filled any
    purpose as GitHub will find the CONTRIBUTION.md in the root folder
    directly now ([issue #1227](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1227)).

### Changed

  - Updating the Integration Test README.md to better explain what the
    integration tests for SqlSetup, SqlRSSetup, and SqlRS does ([issue #1315](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1315)).
- SqlServerDsc.Common
  - Connect-UncPath
    - Now support to authenticate using both NetBIOS domain and Fully Qualified
      Domain Name (FQDN) ([issue #1223](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1223)).
  - Connect-SQL
    - Now support to authenticate using both NetBIOS domain and Fully Qualified

    either the `Edition` or `ProductKey` that could be misleading ([issue #1386](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1386)).
  - Updated the parameter descriptions for the parameters `Edition` and
    `ProductKey` that they are mutually exclusive ([issue #1386](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1386)).
- SqlWindowsFirewall
  - Now support to authenticate using both NetBIOS domain and Fully Qualified
    Domain Name (FQDN) ([issue #1223](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1223)).
- SqlDatabaseObjectPermission
  - Since the task that publish Wiki content was updated to correctly handle
    embedded instances the duplicate documentation was removed from the
    resource README.md, and some was added to the schema MOF parameter
    descriptions ([issue #1580](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1580)).
- SqlScript
  - Fixed the URLs in the parameter documentation ([issue #1582](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1582)).

## [14.0.0] - 2020-06-12

### Remove

- SqlServerDsc
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Since the operating system Windows Server 2008 R2 and
    the product SQL Server 2008 R2 has gone end-of-life the DSC resources
    will no longer try to maintain compatibility with them. Moving forward,
    and including this release, there may be code changes that will break
    the resource on Windows Server 2008 R2 or with SQL Server 2008 R2
    ([issue #1514](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1514)).

### Deprecated

The documentation, examples, unit test, and integration tests have been
removed for these deprecated resources. These resources will be removed
in a future release.

- SqlDatabaseOwner
  - This resource is now deprecated. The functionality is now covered by
    a property in the resource _SqlDatabase_ ([issue #966](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/966)).
- SqlDatabaseRecoveryModel
  - This resource is now deprecated. The functionality is now covered by
    a property in the resource _SqlDatabase_ ([issue #967](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/967)).
- SqlServerEndpointState
  - This resource is now deprecated. The functionality is covered by a
    property in the resource _SqlEndpoint_ ([issue #968](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/968)).
- SqlServerNetwork
  - This resource is now deprecated. The functionality is now covered by
    the resources _SqlProtocol_ and _SqlProtocolTcpIp_.

### Added

- SqlSetup
  - Added support for major version upgrade ([issue #1561](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1561)).
- SqlServerDsc
  - Added new resource SqlProtocol ([issue #1377](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1377)).
  - Added new resource SqlProtocolTcpIp ([issue #1378](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1378)).
  - Added new resource SqlDatabaseObjectPermission ([issue #1119](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1119)).
  - Fixing a problem with the latest ModuleBuild 1.7.0 that breaks the CI
    pipeline.
  - Prepare repository for auto-documentation by adding README.md to each
    resource folder with the content from the root README.md.
- SqlServerDsc.Common
  - Added function `Import-Assembly` that can help import an assembly
    into the PowerShell session.
  - Prepared unit tests to support Pester 5 so a minimal conversation
    is only needed later.
  - Updated `Import-SQLPSModule` to better support unit tests.
- CommonTestHelper
  - Added the functions `Get-InvalidOperationRecord` and `Get-InvalidResultRecord`
    that is needed for evaluate localized error message strings for unit tests.
- SqlEndpoint
  - BREAKING CHANGE: A new required property `EndpointType` was added to
    support different types of endpoints in the future. For now the only
    endpoint type that is supported is the database mirror endpoint type
    (`DatabaseMirroring`).
  - Added the property `State` to be able to specify if the endpoint should
    be running, stopped, or disabled. _This property was moved from the now_
    _deprecated DSC resource `SqlServerEndpointState`_.
- SqlSetup
  - A read only property `IsClustered` was added that can be used to determine
    if the instance is clustered.
  - Added the properties `NpEnabled` and `TcpEnabled` ([issue #1161](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1161)).
  - Added the property `UseEnglish` ([issue #1473](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1473)).
- SqlReplication
  - Add integration tests ([issue #755](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/755).
- SqlDatabase
  - The property `OwnerName` was added.
- SqlDatabasePermission
  - Now possible to change permissions for database user-defined roles
    (e.g. public) and database application roles ([issue #1498](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1498).
- SqlServerDsc.Common
  - The helper function `Restart-SqlService` was improved to handle Failover
    Clusters better. Now the SQL Server service will only be taken offline
    and back online again if the service is online to begin with.
  - The helper function `Restart-SqlServer` learned the new parameter
    `OwnerNode`. The parameter `OwnerNode` takes an array of Cluster node
    names. Using this parameter the cluster group will only be taken
    offline and back online if the cluster group owner is one specified
    in this parameter.
  - The helper function `Compare-ResourcePropertyState` was improved to
    handle embedded instances by adding a parameter `CimInstanceKeyProperties`
    that can be used to identify the unique parameter for each embedded
    instance in a collection.
  - The helper function `Test-DscPropertyState` was improved to evaluate
    the properties in a single CIM instance or a collection of CIM instances
    by recursively call itself.
  - When the helper function `Test-DscPropertyState` evaluated an array
    the verbose messages was not very descriptive. Instead of outputting
    the side indicator from the compare it now outputs a descriptive
    message.

  - BREAKING CHANGE: Database changed to DatabaseName for consistency with
    other modules ([issue #1484](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1484)).
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The resource no longer create the database user if
    it does not exist. Use the resource _SqlDatabaseUser_ to enforce that
    the database user exist in the database prior to setting permissions
    using this resource ([issue #848](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/848)).
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The resource no longer checks if a login exist so that
    it is possible to set permissions for database users that does not
    have a login, e.g. the database user 'guest' ([issue #1134](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1134)).
  - Updated examples.
  - Added integration tests ([issue #741](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/741)).
  - Get-TargetResource will no longer throw an exception if the database
    does not exist.
- SqlDatabaseRecoveryModel

  - Normalize parameter descriptive text for default values.
- SqlDatabaseRole
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The parameter `ServerName` is now non-mandatory and
    defaults to `$env:COMPUTERNAME` ([issue #319](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/319)).

  - BREAKING CHANGE: Database changed to DatabaseName for consistency with
    other modules ([issue #1484](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1484)).
- SqlDatabaseUser
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The parameter `ServerName` is now non-mandatory and
    defaults to `$env:COMPUTERNAME` ([issue #319](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/319)).
  - Normalize parameter descriptive text for default values.
- SqlScript
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The parameter `ServerInstance` is replaced by the two
    parameters `ServerName` and `InstanceName`. The parameter `InstanceName`
    is the only one mandatory which fixes the issue that it was possible to
    run the same script using different host names ([issue #925](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/925)).
- SqlScriptQuery
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The parameter `ServerInstance` is replaced by the two
    parameters `ServerName` and `InstanceName`. The parameter `InstanceName`
    is the only one mandatory which fixes the issue that it was possible to
    run the same query using different host names ([issue #925](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/925)).
- SqlConfiguration
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The parameter `ServerName` is now non-mandatory and

- SqlServiceAccount
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The parameter `ServerName` is now non-mandatory and
    defaults to `$env:COMPUTERNAME` ([issue #319](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/319)).
  - Normalize parameter descriptive text for default values.
- SqlSetup
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Now if the parameter `AgtSvcStartupType` is not specified
    in the configuration the resource will no longer by default add an
    argument to `setup.exe` with a value of `Automatic` for the argument
    `AGTSVCSTARTUPTYPE`. If the parameter `AgtSvcStartupType` is not specified
    in the configuration there will be no setup argument added at all
    ([issue #464](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/464)).
  - BREAKING CHANGE: When installing a failover cluster the cluster
    validation is no longer skipped by default. To skip cluster validation
    the configuration must opt-in by specifying the following
    `SkipRule = 'Cluster_VerifyForErrors'` ([issue #335](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/335)).
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Now, unless the parameter `SuppressReboot` is set to
    `$true`, the node will be restarted if the setup ends with the
    [error code 3010](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/tn-archive/bb418811(v=technet.10)#server-setup-fails-with-code-3010).
    Previously just a warning message was written ([issue #565](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/565)).

### Fixed

- SqlServerDsc
  - The regular expression for `minor-version-bump-message` in the file
    `GitVersion.yml` was changed to only raise minor version when the
    commit message contain the word `add`, `adds`, `minor`, `feature`,
    or `features`.
  - Now code coverage is reported to Codecov, and a codecov.yml was added.
  - Updated to support DscResource.Common v0.7.1.
  - Changed to point to CONTRIBUTING.md on master branch to avoid "404 Page not found"
    ([issue #1508](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1508)).
- SqlAGDatabase
  - Fixed unit tests that failed intermittently when running unit tests
    in PowerShell 7 ([issue #1532](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1532)).
  - Minor code style issue changes.
- SqlAgentAlert
  - The parameter `ServerName` now throws when passing an empty string or
    null value (part of [issue #319](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/319)).
- SqlAgentFailsafe
  - The parameter `ServerName` now throws when passing an empty string or
    null value (part of [issue #319](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/319)).
- SqlAgentOperator
  - The parameter `ServerName` now throws when passing an empty string or
    null value (part of [issue #319](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/319)).
- SqlAlias
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The parameter `ServerName` is now non-mandatory to
    prevent ping-pong behavior ([issue #1502](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1502)).
    The `ServerName` is not returned as an empty string when the protocol is
    Named Pipes.
- SqlDatabase
  - Fixed missing parameter `CompatibilityLevel` in the README.md (and
    updated the description in the schema.mof).
- SqlRs
  - Fix typo in the schema parameter `SuppressRestart` description
    and in the parameter description in the `README.md`.
- SqlDatabaseMail
  - The parameter `ServerName` now throws when passing an empty string or
    null value (part of [issue #319](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/319)).
- SqlServerEndpoint
  - The parameter `ServerName` now throws when passing an empty string or
    null value (part of [issue #319](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/319)).

    message that have the actual error that occurred.
  - Corrected the examples.
- SqlSetup
  - Update integration tests to correctly detect sysadmins because of changes
    to the build worker.
  - The property `SqlTempdbLogFileGrowth` and `SqlTempdbFileGrowth` now returns
    the correct values. Previously the value of the growth was wrongly
    divided by 1KB even if the value was in percent. Now the value for growth
    is the sum of the average of MB and average of the percentage.
  - The function `Get-TargetResource` was changed so that the property
    `SQLTempDBDir` will now return the database `tempdb`'s property
    `PrimaryFilePath`.
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Logic that was under feature flag `DetectionSharedFeatures`
    was made the default and old logic that was used to detect shared features
    was removed ([issue #1290](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1290)).
    This was implemented because the previous implementation did not work
    fully with SQL Server 2017.
  - Much of the code was refactored into units (functions) to be easier to test.
    Due to the size of the code the unit tests ran for an abnormal long time,
    after this refactoring the unit tests runs much quicker.

  - Removed the helper function `New-TerminatingError`, `New-WarningMessage`
    and `New-VerboseMessage` in favor of the the new
    [localization helper functions](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DscResources/blob/master/StyleGuidelines.md#localization).
  - Combine DscResource.LocalizationHelper and DscResource.Common into
    SqlServerDsc.Common ([issue #1357](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1357)).
  - Update Assert-TestEnvironment.ps1 to not error if strict mode is enabled
    and there are no missing dependencies ([issue #1368](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1368)).
- Changes to SqlServerDsc.Common
  - Added StatementTimeout to function 'Connect-SQL' with default 600 seconds (10mins).
  - Added StatementTimeout to function 'Invoke-Query' with default 600 seconds (10mins)

    - The function now make it more clear that when using the parameter
      `SetupCredential` is impersonates that user, and by default it does
      not impersonates a user but uses the credential that the resource

    name list may have been returned as a string instead of as a string array
    ([issue #1368](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1368)).

## [12.5.0.0] - 2019-05-15

    instructing users to use the 'SYSTEM' service account instead of
    'LocalSystem'.
- Changes to SqlScript
  - Correctly passes the `$VerbosePreference` to the helper function
    `Invoke-SqlScript` so that `PRINT` statements is outputted correctly
    when verbose output is requested, e.g
    `Start-DscConfiguration -Verbose`.
  - Added en-US localization ([issue #624](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/624)).
  - Added additional unit tests for code coverage.
- Changes to SqlScriptQuery
  - Correctly passes the `$VerbosePreference` to the helper function
    `Invoke-SqlScript` so that `PRINT` statements is outputted correctly
    when verbose output is requested, e.g

  - Added en-US localization.
  - Added additional unit tests for code coverage.
- Changes to SqlSetup
  - Concatenated Robocopy localization strings ([issue #694](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/694)).

    function calls the Test-TargetResource function to verify the desired
    state.
- Changes to SqlWaitForAG
  - Added en-US localization ([issue #625](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/625)).

  - Refactored unit tests to simplify them add add slightly more code
    coverage.
- Changes to SqlServerMaxDop
  - Added en-US localization ([issue #616](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/616)).
- Changes to SqlRS
  - Reporting Services are restarted after changing settings, unless

    `$SuppressRestart` will also prevent Reporting Services restart after initialization.
  - Fixed one of the error handling to use localization, and made the
    error message more descriptive when the Set-TargetResource function
    calls the Test-TargetResource function to verify the desired
    state. _This was done prior to adding full en-US localization_.
  - Fixed ([issue #1258](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1258)).
    When initializing Reporting Services, there is no need to execute `InitializeReportServer`
    CIM method, since executing `SetDatabaseConnection` CIM method initializes
    Reporting Services.

  - Added en-US localization ([issue #603](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/608)).
- Changes to SqlAlias
  - Added en-US localization ([issue #602](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/602)).
  - Removed ShouldProcess for the code, since it has no purpose in a DSC
    resource ([issue #242](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/242)).
- Changes to SqlServerReplication
  - Added en-US localization ([issue #620](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/620)).
  - Refactored Get-TargetResource slightly so it provide better verbose
    messages.

## [12.4.0.0] - 2019-04-03

### Changed

- Changes to SqlServerDsc
  - Added new resources.
    - SqlRSSetup
  - Added helper module DscResource.Common from the repository
    DscResource.Template.
    - Moved all helper functions from SqlServerDscHelper.psm1 to DscResource.Common.
    - Renamed Test-SqlDscParameterState to Test-DscParameterState.
    - New-TerminatingError error text for a missing localized message now matches
      the output even if the "missing localized message" localized message is
      also missing.
  - Added helper module DscResource.LocalizationHelper from the repository
    DscResource.Template, this replaces the helper module CommonResourceHelper.psm1.
  - Cleaned up unit tests, mostly around loading cmdlet stubs and loading
    classes stubs, but also some tests that were using some odd variants.
  - Fix all integration tests according to issue [PowerShell/DscResource.Template#14](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DscResource.Template/issues/14).
- Changes to SqlServerMemory
  - Updated Cim Class to Win32_ComputerSystem (instead of Win32_PhysicalMemory)
    because the correct memory size was not being detected correctly on Azure VMs
    ([issue #914](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/914)).
- Changes to SqlSetup
  - Split integration tests into two jobs, one for running integration tests
    for SQL Server 2016 and another for running integration test for
    SQL Server 2017 ([issue #858](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/858)).
  - Localized messages for Master Data Services no longer start and end with
    single quote.
  - When installing features a verbose message is written if a feature is found
    to already be installed. It no longer quietly removes the feature from the
    `/FEATURES` argument.
  - Cleaned up a bit in the tests, removed excessive piping.
  - Fixed minor typo in examples.
  - A new optional parameter `FeatureFlag` parameter was added to control
    breaking changes. Functionality added under a feature flag can be
    toggled on or off, and could be changed later to be the default.
    This way we can also make more of the new functionalities the default
    in the same breaking change release ([issue #1105](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1105)).
  - Added a new way of detecting if the shared feature CONN (Client Tools
    Connectivity, and SQL Client Connectivity SDK), BC (Client Tools
    Backwards Compatibility), and SDK (Client Tools SDK) is installed or
    not. The new functionality is used when the parameter `FeatureFlag`
    is set to `'DetectionSharedFeatures'` ([issue #1105](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1105)).
  - Added a new helper function `Get-InstalledSharedFeatures` to move out
    some of the code from the `Get-TargetResource` to make unit testing
    easier and faster.
  - Changed the logic of 'Build the argument string to be passed to setup' to
    not quote the value if root directory is specified
    ([issue #1254](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1254)).
  - Moved some resource specific helper functions to the new helper module
    DscResource.Common so they can be shared with the new resource SqlRSSetup.
  - Improved verbose messages in Test-TargetResource function to more
    clearly tell if features are already installed or not.
  - Refactored unit tests for the functions Test-TargetResource and
    Set-TargetResource to improve testing speed.
  - Modified the Test-TargetResource and Set-TargetResource to not be
    case-sensitive when comparing feature names. _This was handled
    correctly in real-world scenarios, but failed when running the unit
    tests (and testing casing)._
- Changes to SqlAGDatabase
  - Fix MatchDatabaseOwner to check for CONTROL SERVER, IMPERSONATE LOGIN, or
    CONTROL LOGIN permission in addition to IMPERSONATE ANY LOGIN.
  - Update and fix MatchDatabaseOwner help text.
- Changes to SqlAG
  - Updated documentation on the behavior of defaults as they only apply when
    creating a group.
- Changes to SqlAGReplica
  - AvailabilityMode, BackupPriority, and FailoverMode defaults only apply when
    creating a replica not when making changes to an existing replica. Explicit
    parameters will still change existing replicas ([issue #1244](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1244)).
  - ReadOnlyRoutingList now gets updated without throwing an error on the first
    run ([issue #518](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/518)).
  - Test-Resource fixed to report whether ReadOnlyRoutingList desired state
    has been reached correctly ([issue #1305](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1305)).
- Changes to SqlDatabaseDefaultLocation
  - No longer does the Test-TargetResource fail on the second test run
    when the backup file path was changed, and the path was ending with
    a backslash ([issue #1307](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1307)).

## [12.3.0.0] - 2019-02-20

### Changed

- Changes to SqlServerDsc
  - Reverting the change that was made as part of the
    [issue #1260](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1260)
    in the previous release, as it only mitigated the issue, it did not
    solve the issue.
  - Removed the container testing since that broke the integration tests,
    possible due to using excessive amount of memory on the AppVeyor build
    worker. This will make the unit tests to take a bit longer to run
    ([issue #1260](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1260)).
  - The unit tests and the integration tests are now run in two separate
    build workers in AppVeyor. One build worker runs the integration tests,
    while a second build worker runs the unit tests. The build workers runs
    in parallel on paid accounts, but sequentially on free accounts
    ([issue #1260](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1260)).
  - Clean up error handling in some of the integration tests that was
    part of a workaround for a bug in Pester. The bug is resolved, and
    the error handling is not again built into Pester.
  - Speeding up the AppVeyor tests by splitting the common tests in a
    separate build job.
  - Updated the appveyor.yml to have the correct build step, and also
    correct run the build step only in one of the jobs.
  - Update integration tests to use the new integration test template.
  - Added SqlAgentOperator resource.
- Changes to SqlServiceAccount
  - Fixed Get-ServiceObject when searching for Integration Services service.
    Unlike the rest of SQL Server services, the Integration Services service
    cannot be instanced, however you can have multiple versions installed.
    Get-Service object would return the correct service name that you
    are looking for, but it appends the version number at the end. Added
    parameter VersionNumber so the search would return the correct
    service name.
  - Added code to allow for using Managed Service Accounts.
  - Now the correct service type string value is returned by the function
    `Get-TargetResource`. Previously one value was passed in as a parameter
    (e.g. `DatabaseEngine`), but a different string value as returned
    (e.g. `SqlServer`). Now `Get-TargetResource` return the same values
    that can be passed as values in the parameter `ServiceType`
    ([issue #981](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/981)).
- Changes to SqlServerLogin
  - Fixed issue in Test-TargetResource to valid password on disabled accounts
    ([issue #915](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/915)).
  - Now when adding a login of type SqlLogin, and the SQL Server login mode
    is set to `'Integrated'`, an error is correctly thrown
    ([issue #1179](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1179)).
- Changes to SqlSetup
  - Updated the integration test to stop the named instance while installing
    the other instances to mitigate
    [issue #1260](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1260).
  - Add parameters to configure the 'tempdb' files during the installation of
    the instance. The new parameters are SqlTempdbFileCount, SqlTempdbFileSize,
    SqlTempdbFileGrowth, SqlTempdbLogFileSize and SqlTempdbLogFileGrowth
    ([issue #1167](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1167)).
- Changes to SqlServerEndpoint
  - Add the optional parameter Owner. The default owner remains the login used
    for the creation of the endpoint
    ([issue #1251](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1251)).
    [Maxime Daniou (@mdaniou)](https://github.com/mdaniou)
  - Add integration tests
    ([issue #744](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/744)).
    [Maxime Daniou (@mdaniou)](https://github.com/mdaniou)

## [12.2.0.0] - 2019-01-09

### Changed

- Changes to SqlServerDsc
  - During testing in AppVeyor the Build Worker is restarted in the install
    step to make sure the are no residual changes left from a previous SQL
    Server install on the Build Worker done by the AppVeyor Team
    ([issue #1260](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1260)).
  - Code cleanup: Change parameter names of Connect-SQL to align with resources.
  - Updated README.md in the Examples folder.
    - Added a link to the new xADObjectPermissionEntry examples in
      ActiveDirectory, fixed a broken link and a typo.
      [Adam Rush (@adamrushuk)](https://github.com/adamrushuk)
- Change to SqlServerLogin so it doesn't check properties for absent logins.
  - Fix for ([issue #1096](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1096))

      using the path (and not the .psd1 file).
    - Fixed so that the verbose message correctly
      shows the name, version and path when importing
      the module SQLPS (it did show correctly for the
      SqlServer module).
- Changes to SqlAg, SqlAGDatabase, and SqlAGReplica examples
  - Included configuration for SqlAlwaysOnService to enable

### Changed

- Changes to SqlServerDatabaseMail
  - DisplayName is now properly treated as display name
    for the originating email address ([issue #1200](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issue/1200)).

    AsSvcStartupType, IsSvcStartupType and RsSvcStartupType ([issue #1165](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1165).
    [Maxime Daniou (@mdaniou)](https://github.com/mdaniou)

## [11.4.0.0] - 2018-07-25

### Changed

- Changes to SqlServerDsc
  - Updated helper function Restart-SqlService to have to new optional parameters
    `SkipClusterCheck` and `SkipWaitForOnline`. This was to support more aspects
    of the resource SqlServerNetwork.
  - Updated helper function `Import-SQLPSModule`
    - To only import module if the
      module does not exist in the session.
    - To always import the latest version of 'SqlServer' or 'SQLPS' module, if
      more than one version exist on the target node. It will still prefer to
      use 'SqlServer' module.
  - Updated all the examples and integration tests to not use
    `PSDscAllowPlainTextPassword`, so examples using credentials or
    passwords by default are secure.
- Changes to SqlAlwaysOnService
  - Integration tests was updated to handle new IPv6 addresses on the AppVeyor
    build worker ([issue #1155](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1155)).

    ([issue #751](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/751)).
- Changes to SqlAG
  - Removed excess `Import-SQLPSModule` call.
- Changes to SqlSetup
  - Now after a successful install the "SQL PowerShell module" is reevaluated and
    forced to be reimported into the session. This is to support that a never

## [11.1.0.0] - 2018-03-21

### Changed

- Changes to SqlServerDsc
  - Updated the PULL\_REQUEST\_TEMPLATE with an improved task list and modified
    some text to be clearer ([issue #973](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/973)).
  - Updated the ISSUE_TEMPLATE to hopefully be more intuitive and easier to use.
  - Added information to ISSUE_TEMPLATE that issues must be reproducible in
    SqlServerDsc resource module (if running the older xSQLServer resource module)
    ([issue #1036](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1036)).
  - Updated ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md with a note about sensitive information ([issue #1092](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1092)).
- Changes to SqlServerLogin
  - [Claudio Spizzi (@claudiospizzi)](https://github.com/claudiospizzi): Fix password
    test fails for nativ sql users ([issue #1048](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1048)).
- Changes to SqlSetup
  - [Michael Fyffe (@TraGicCode)](https://github.com/TraGicCode): Clarify usage
    of 'SecurityMode' along with adding parameter validations for the only 2
    supported values ([issue #1010](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1010)).
  - Now accounts containing '$' will be able to be used for installing
    SQL Server. Although, if the account ends with '$' it is considered a
    Managed Service Account ([issue #1055](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1055)).
- Changes to Integration Tests
  - [Michael Fyffe (@TraGicCode)](https://github.com/TraGicCode): Replace xStorage
    dsc resource module with StorageDsc ([issue #1038](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1038)).

    the following resources unit test template to version 1.2.1
    - SqlAlias ([issue #999](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/999)).
    - SqlWindowsFirewall ([issue #1089](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1089)).

## [11.0.0.0] - 2018-02-07

### Changed

- Changes to SqlServerDsc
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Resource SqlRSSecureConnectionLevel was remove
    ([issue #990](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/990)).
    The parameter that was set using that resource has been merged into resource
    SqlRS as the parameter UseSsl. The UseSsl parameter is of type boolean. This
    change was made because from SQL Server 2008 R2 this value is made an on/off
    switch. Read more in the article [ConfigurationSetting Method - SetSecureConnectionLevel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/reporting-services/wmi-provider-library-reference/configurationsetting-method-setsecureconnectionlevel).
  - Updated so that named parameters are used for New-Object cmdlet. This was
    done to follow the style guideline.
  - Updated manifest and license to reflect the new year
    ([issue #965](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/965)).
  - Added a README.md under Tests\Integration to help contributors to write
    integration tests.
  - Added 'Integration tests' section in the CONTRIBUTING.md.
  - The complete examples were removed. They were no longer accurate and some
    referenced resources that no longer exist. Accurate examples can be found
    in each specific resource example folder. Examples for installing Failover Cluster
    can be found in the resource examples folders in the xFailOverCluster
    resource module ([issue #462](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/462)).
  - A README.md was created under the Examples folder to be used as reference how
    to install certain scenarios ([issue #462](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/462)).
  - Removed the local specific common test for compiling examples in this repository
    and instead opted-in for the common test in the 'DscResource.Tests' repository
    ([issue #669](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/669)).
  - Added new resource SqlServerDatabaseMail for configuring SQL Server
    Database Mail ([issue #155](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/155)).
  - Updated the helper function Test-SQLDscParameterState to handle the
    data type UInt16.
  - Fixed typo in SqlServerDscCommon.Tests.
  - Updated README.md with known issue section for each resource.
  - Resources that did not have a description in the README.md now has one.
  - Resources that missed links to the examples in the README.md now has those
    links.
  - Style changes in all examples, removing type [System.Management.Automation.Credential()]
    from credential parameters ([issue #1003](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1003)),
    and renamed the credential parameter so it is not using abbreviation.
  - Updated the security token for AppVeyor status badge in README.md. When we
    renamed the repository the security token was changed
    ([issue #1012](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1012)).
  - Now the helper function Restart-SqlService, after restarting the SQL Server
    service, does not return until it can connect to the SQL Server instance, and
    the instance returns status 'Online' ([issue #1008](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1008)).
    If it fails to connect within the timeout period (defaults to 120 seconds) it
    throws an error.
  - Fixed typo in comment-base help for helper function Test-AvailabilityReplicaSeedingModeAutomatic.
  - Style cleanup in helper functions and tests.

  - Style cleanup in tests.
- Changes to SqlRS
  - Replaced Get-WmiObject with Get-CimInstance to fix Script Analyzer warnings
    ([issue #264](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/264)).
  - Refactored the resource to use Invoke-CimMethod.
  - Added parameter UseSsl which when set to $true forces connections to the
    Reporting Services to use SSL when connecting ([issue #990](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/990)).
  - Added complete example for SqlRS (based on the integration tests)
    ([issue #634](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/634)).

## [8.2.0.0] - 2017-10-05

### Changed

- Changes to xSQLServer
  - Updated appveyor.yml so that integration tests run in order and so that
    the SQLPS module folders are renamed to not disturb the units test, but
    can be renamed back by the integration tests xSQLServerSetup so that the
    integration tests can run successfully
    ([issue #774](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/774)).
  - Changed so the maximum version to be installed is 4.0.6.0, when running unit
    tests in AppVeyor. Quick fix until we can resolve the unit tests (see
    [issue #807](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/807)).
  - Moved the code block, that contains workarounds in appveyor.yml, so it is run
    during the install phase instead of the test phase.
  - Fix problem with tests breaking with Pester 4.0.7 ([issue #807](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/807)).
- Changes to xSQLServerHelper
  - Changes to Connect-SQL and Import-SQLPSModule
    - Now it correctly loads the correct assemblies when SqlServer module is
      present ([issue #649](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/649)).
    - Now SQLPS module will be correctly loaded (discovered) after installation
      of SQL Server. Previously resources depending on SQLPS module could fail
      because SQLPS was not found after installation because the PSModulePath
      environment variable in the (LCM) PowerShell session did not contain the new
      module path.
  - Added new helper function "Test-ClusterPermissions" ([issue #446](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/446)).
- Changes to xSQLServerSetup
  - Fixed an issue with trailing slashes in the 'UpdateSource' property
    ([issue #720](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/720)).
  - Fixed so that the integration test renames back the SQLPS module folders if
    they was renamed by AppVeyor (in the appveyor.yml file)
    ([issue #774](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/774)).
  - Fixed so integration test does not write warnings when SQLPS module is loaded
    ([issue #798](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/798)).
  - Changes to integration tests.
    - Moved the configuration block from the MSFT\_xSQLServerSetup.Integration.Tests.ps1
      to the MSFT\_xSQLServerSetup.config.ps1 to align with the other integration
      test. And also get most of the configuration in one place.
    - Changed the tests so that the local SqlInstall account is added as a member
      of the local administrators group.
    - Changed the tests so that the local SqlInstall account is added as a member
      of the system administrators in SQL Server (Database Engine) - needed for the
      xSQLServerAlwaysOnService integration tests.
    - Changed so that only one of the Modules-folder for the SQLPS PowerShell module
      for SQL Server 2016 is renamed back so it can be used with the integration
      tests. There was an issue when more than one SQLPS module was present (see
      more information in [issue #806](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/806)).
    - Fixed wrong variable name for SQL service credential. It was using the
      integration test variable name instead of the parameter name.
    - Added ErrorAction 'Stop' to the cmdlet Start-DscConfiguration
      ([issue #824](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/824)).
- Changes to xSQLServerAlwaysOnAvailabilityGroup
  - Change the check of the values entered as parameter for
    BasicAvailabilityGroup. It is a boolean, hence it was not possible to
    disable the feature.
  - Add possibility to enable/disable the feature DatabaseHealthTrigger
    (SQL Server 2016 or later only).
  - Add possibility to enable the feature DtcSupportEnabled (SQL Server 2016 or
    later only). The feature currently can't be altered once the Availability
    Group is created.
  - Use the new helper function "Test-ClusterPermissions".
  - Refactored the unit tests to allow them to be more user friendly.
  - Added the following read-only properties to the schema ([issue #476](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/476))
    - EndpointPort
    - EndpointURL
    - SQLServerNetName
    - Version
  - Use the Get-PrimaryReplicaServerObject helper function.
- Changes to xSQLServerAlwaysOnAvailabilityGroupReplica
  - Fixed the formatting for the AvailabilityGroupNotFound error.
  - Added the following read-only properties to the schema ([issue #477](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/477))
    - EndpointPort
    - EndpointURL
  - Use the new helper function "Test-ClusterPermissions".
  - Use the Get-PrimaryReplicaServerObject helper function
- Changes to xSQLServerHelper
  - Fixed Connect-SQL by ensuring the Status property returns 'Online' prior to
    returning the SQL Server object ([issue #333](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/333)).
- Changes to xSQLServerRole
  - Running Get-DscConfiguration no longer throws an error saying property
    Members is not an array ([issue #790](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/790)).

  - Fixed error where Measure-Object cmdlet would fail claiming it could not
    find the specified property ([issue #801](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/801))

    - AvailabilityGroups
    - Databases
    - EndpointCollection
  - Added a new overload to the Login class

    - AvailabilityDatabases
    - AvailabilityReplicas
- Added new resource xSQLServerAccount ([issue #706](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/706))
  - Added localization support for all strings
  - Added examples for usage
- Changes to xSQLServerRSConfig
  - No longer returns a null value from Test-TargetResource when Reporting
    Services has not been initialized ([issue #822](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/822)).
  - Fixed so that when two Reporting Services are installed for the same major
    version the resource does not throw an error ([issue #819](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/819)).
  - Now the resource will restart the Reporting Services service after
    initializing ([issue #592](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/592)).
    This will enable the Reports site to work.
  - Added integration test ([issue #753](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/753)).
  - Added support for configuring URL reservations and virtual directory names
    ([issue #570](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/570))

## [8.0.0.0] - 2017-07-12

### Changed

- BREAKING CHANGE: The module now requires WMF 5.
  - This is required for class-based resources
- Added new resource
  - xSQLServerAlwaysOnAvailabilityGroupDatabaseMembership
  - Added localization support for all strings.
  - Refactored as a MOF based resource due to challenges with Pester and testing
    in Powershell 5.
- Changes to xSQLServer
  - BREAKING CHANGE: xSQLServer does no longer try to support WMF 4.0 (PowerShell
    4.0) (issue #574). Minimum supported version of WMF is now 5.0 (PowerShell 5.0).
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Removed deprecated resource xSQLAOGroupJoin (issue #457).
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Removed deprecated resource xSQLAOGroupEnsure (issue #456).
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Removed deprecated resource xSQLServerFailoverClusterSetup
    (issue #336).
  - Updated PULL\_REQUEST\_TEMPLATE adding comment block around text. Also
    rearranged and updated texts (issue #572).
  - Added common helper functions for HQRM localization, and added tests for the
    helper functions.
    - Get-LocalizedData
    - New-InvalidResultException
    - New-ObjectNotFoundException
    - New-InvalidOperationException
    - New-InvalidArgumentException
  - Updated CONTRIBUTING.md describing the new localization helper functions.
  - Fixed typos in xSQLServer.strings.psd1
  - Fixed CodeCov badge links in README.md so that they point to the correct branch.
  - Added VS Code workspace settings file with formatting settings matching the
    Style Guideline (issue #645). That will make it possible inside VS Code to press
    SHIFT+ALT+F, or press F1 and choose 'Format document' in the list. The
    PowerShell code will then be formatted according to the Style Guideline
    (although maybe not complete, but would help a long way).
    - Removed powershell.codeFormatting.alignPropertyValuePairs setting since
      it does not align with the style guideline.
    - Added powershell.codeFormatting.preset with a value of 'Custom' so that
      workspace formatting settings are honored (issue #665).
  - Fixed lint error MD013 and MD036 in README.md.
  - Updated .markdownlint.json to enable rule MD013 and MD036 to enforce those
    lint markdown rules in the common tests.
  - Fixed lint error MD013 in CHANGELOG.md.
  - Fixed lint error MD013 in CONTRIBUTING.md.
  - Added code block around types in README.md.
  - Updated copyright information in xSQLServer.psd1.
  - Opt-in for markdown common tests (issue #668).
    - The old markdown tests has been removed.
- Changes to xSQLServerHelper
  - Removed helper function Grant-ServerPerms because the deprecated resource that
    was using it was removed.
  - Removed helper function Grant-CNOPerms because the deprecated resource that
    was using it was removed.
  - Removed helper function New-ListenerADObject because the deprecated resource
    that was using it was removed.
  - Added tests for those helper functions that did not have tests.
  - Test-SQLDscParameterState helper function can now correctly pass a CimInstance
    as DesiredValue.
  - Test-SQLDscParameterState helper function will now output a warning message
    if the value type of a desired value is not supported.
  - Added localization to helper functions (issue #641).
    - Resolved the issue when using Write-Verbose in helper functions discussed
      in #641 where Write-Verbose wouldn't write out verbose messages unless using
      parameter Verbose.
    - Moved localization strings from xSQLServer.strings.psd1 to
      xSQLServerHelper.strings.psd1.
- Changes to xSQLServerSetup
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Replaced StartWin32Process helper function with the cmdlet
    Start-Process (issue #41, #93 and #126).
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The parameter SetupCredential has been removed since it is
    no longer needed. This is because the resource now support the built-in
    PsDscRunAsCredential.
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Now the resource supports using built-in PsDscRunAsCredential.
    If PsDscRunAsCredential is set, that username will be used as the first system
    administrator.
  - BREAKING CHANGE: If the parameter PsDscRunAsCredential are not assigned any
    credentials then the resource will start the setup process as the SYSTEM account.
    When installing as the SYSTEM account, then parameter SQLSysAdminAccounts and
    ASSysAdminAccounts must be specified when installing feature Database Engine
    and Analysis Services respectively.
  - When setup exits with the exit code 3010 a warning message is written to console
    telling that setup finished successfully, but a reboot is required (partly fixes
    issue #565).
  - When setup exits with an exit code other than 0 or 3010 a warning message is
    written to console telling that setup finished with an error (partly fixes
    issue #580).
  - Added a new parameter SetupProcessTimeout which defaults to 7200 seconds (2
    hours). If the setup process has not finished before the timeout value in
    SetupProcessTimeout an error will be thrown (issue #566).
  - Updated all examples to match the removal of SetupCredential.
  - Updated (removed) severe known issues in README.md for resource xSQLServerSetup.
  - Now all major version uses the same identifier to evaluate InstallSharedDir
    and InstallSharedWOWDir (issue #420).
  - Now setup arguments that contain no value will be ignored, for example when
    InstallSharedDir and
    InstallSharedWOWDir path is already present on the target node, because of a
    previous installation (issue #639).
  - Updated Get-TargetResource to correctly detect BOL, Conn, BC and other tools
    when they are installed without SQLENGINE (issue #591).
  - Now it can detect Documentation Components correctly after the change in
    issue #591 (issue #628)
  - Fixed bug that prevented Get-DscConfiguration from running without error. The
    return hash table fails if the $clusteredSqlIpAddress variable is not used.
    The schema expects a string array but it is initialized as just a null string,
    causing it to fail on Get-DscConfiguration (issue #393).
  - Added localization support for all strings.
  - Added a test to test some error handling for cluster installations.
  - Added support for MDS feature install (issue #486)
    - Fixed localization support for MDS feature (issue #671).
- Changes to xSQLServerRSConfig
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Removed `$SQLAdminCredential` parameter. Use common parameter
    `PsDscRunAsCredential` (WMF 5.0+) to run the resource under different credentials.
    `PsDscRunAsCredential` Windows account must be a sysadmin on SQL Server (issue
    #568).
  - In addition, the resource no longer uses `Invoke-Command` cmdlet that was used
    to impersonate the Windows user specified by `$SQLAdminCredential`. The call
    also needed CredSSP authentication to be enabled and configured on the target
    node, which complicated deployments in non-domain scenarios. Using
    `PsDscRunAsCredential` solves this problems for us.
  - Fixed virtual directory creation for SQL Server 2016 (issue #569).
  - Added unit tests (issue #295).
- Changes to xSQLServerDatabase
  - Changed the readme, SQLInstance should have been SQLInstanceName.
- Changes to xSQLServerScript
  - Fixed bug with schema and variable mismatch for the Credential/Username parameter
    in the return statement (issue #661).
  - Optional QueryTimeout parameter to specify sql script query execution timeout.
    Fixes issue #597
- Changes to xSQLServerAlwaysOnService
  - Fixed typos in localization strings and in tests.
- Changes to xSQLServerAlwaysOnAvailabilityGroup
  - Now it utilize the value of 'FailoverMode' to set the 'FailoverMode' property
    of the Availability Group instead of wrongly using the 'AvailabilityMode'
    property of the Availability Group.

## [7.1.0.0] - 2017-05-31

### Changed

- Changes to xSQLServerMemory
  - Changed the way SQLServer parameter is passed from Test-TargetResource to
    Get-TargetResource so that the default value isn't lost (issue #576).
  - Added condition to unit tests for when no SQLServer parameter is set.
- Changes to xSQLServerMaxDop
  - Changed the way SQLServer parameter is passed from Test-TargetResource to
    Get-TargetResource so that the default value isn't lost (issue #576).
  - Added condition to unit tests for when no SQLServer parameter is set.
- Changes to xWaitForAvailabilityGroup
  - Updated README.md with a description for the resources and revised the parameter
    descriptions.

    for RetryCount is now 30 times (issue #505).
  - Cleaned up code and fixed PSSA rules warnings (issue #268).
  - Added unit tests (issue #297).
  - Added descriptive text to README.md that the account that runs the resource
    must have permission to run the cmdlet Get-ClusterGroup (issue #307).
  - Added read-only parameter GroupExist which will return $true if the cluster
    role/group exist, otherwise it returns $false (issue #510).
  - Added examples.
- Changes to xSQLServerPermission
  - Cleaned up code, removed SupportsShouldProcess and fixed PSSA rules warnings
    (issue #241 and issue #262).
  - It is now possible to add permissions to two or more logins on the same instance
    (issue #526).
  - The parameter NodeName is no longer mandatory and has now the default value
    of $env:COMPUTERNAME.
  - The parameter Ensure now has a default value of 'Present'.
  - Updated README.md with a description for the resources and revised the parameter
    descriptions.
  - Removed dependency of SQLPS provider (issue #482).
  - Added ConnectSql permission. Now that permission can also be granted or revoked.
  - Updated note in resource description to also mention ConnectSql permission.
- Changes to xSQLServerHelper module
  - Removed helper function Get-SQLPSInstance and Get-SQLPSInstanceName because
    there is no resource using it any longer.
  - Added four new helper functions.
    - Register-SqlSmo, Register-SqlWmiManagement and Unregister-SqlAssemblies to
      handle the creation on the application domain and loading and unloading of
      the SMO and SqlWmiManagement assemblies.
    - Get-SqlInstanceMajorVersion to get the major SQL version for a specific instance.
  - Fixed typos in comment-based help
- Changes to xSQLServer
  - Fixed typos in markdown files; CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, README and ISSUE_TEMPLATE.
  - Fixed typos in schema.mof files (and README.md).
  - Updated some parameter description in schema.mof files on those that was found
    was not equal to README.md.
- Changes to xSQLServerAlwaysOnService
  - Get-TargetResource should no longer fail silently with error 'Index operation
    failed; the array index evaluated to null.' (issue #519). Now if the
    Server.IsHadrEnabled property return neither $true or $false the
    Get-TargetResource function will throw an error.
- Changes to xSQLServerSetUp
  - Updated xSQLServerSetup Module Get-Resource method to fix (issue #516 and #490).
  - Added change to detect DQ, DQC, BOL, SDK features. Now the function
    Test-TargetResource returns true after calling set for DQ, DQC, BOL, SDK
    features (issue #516 and #490).
- Changes to xSQLServerAlwaysOnAvailabilityGroup
  - Updated to return the exception raised when an error is thrown.
- Changes to xSQLServerAlwaysOnAvailabilityGroupReplica
  - Updated to return the exception raised when an error is thrown.
  - Updated parameter description for parameter Name, so that it says it must be
    in the format SQLServer\InstanceName for named instance (issue #548).
- Changes to xSQLServerLogin
  - Added an optional boolean parameter Disabled. It can be used to enable/disable
    existing logins or create disabled logins (new logins are created as enabled
    by default).
- Changes to xSQLServerDatabaseRole
  - Updated variable passed to Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.User constructor
    to fix issue #530
- Changes to xSQLServerNetwork
  - Added optional parameter SQLServer with default value of $env:COMPUTERNAME
    (issue #528).
  - Added optional parameter RestartTimeout with default value of 120 seconds.
  - Now the resource supports restarting a sql server in a cluster (issue #527
    and issue #455).
  - Now the resource allows to set the parameter TcpDynamicPorts to a blank value
    (partly fixes issue #534). Setting a blank value for parameter TcpDynamicPorts
    together with a value for parameter TcpPort means that static port will be used.
  - Now the resource will not call Alter() in the Set-TargetResource when there
    is no change necessary (issue #537).
  - Updated example 1-EnableTcpIpOnCustomStaticPort.
  - Added unit tests (issue #294).
  - Refactored some of the code, cleaned up the rest and fixed PSSA rules warnings
    (issue #261).
  - If parameter TcpDynamicPort is set to '0' at the same time as TcpPort is set
    the resource will now throw an error (issue #535).
  - Added examples (issue #536).
  - When TcpDynamicPorts is set to '0' the Test-TargetResource function will no
    longer fail each time (issue #564).
- Changes to xSQLServerRSConfig
  - Replaced sqlcmd.exe usages with Invoke-SqlCmd calls (issue #567).
- Changes to xSQLServerDatabasePermission
  - Fixed code style, updated README.md and removed *-SqlDatabasePermission functions
    from xSQLServerHelper.psm1.
  - Added the option 'GrantWithGrant' with gives the user grant rights, together
    with the ability to grant others the same right.
  - Now the resource can revoke permission correctly (issue #454). When revoking
    'GrantWithGrant', both the grantee and all the other users the grantee has
    granted the same permission to, will also get their permission revoked.
  - Updated tests to cover Revoke().
- Changes to xSQLServerHelper
  - The missing helper function ('Test-SPDSCObjectHasProperty'), that was referenced
    in the helper function Test-SQLDscParameterState, is now incorporated into
    Test-SQLDscParameterState (issue #589).

  - Fixed code style, added updated parameter descriptions to schema.mof and README.md.
- Changes to xSQLServer
  - Raised the CodeCov target to 70% which is the minimum and required target for
    HQRM resource.
- Changes to xSQLServerRole
  - **BREAKING CHANGE: The resource has been reworked in it's entirely.** Below
    is what has changed.
    - The mandatory parameters now also include ServerRoleName.
    - The ServerRole parameter was before an array of server roles, now this parameter
      is renamed to ServerRoleName and can only be set to one server role.
      - ServerRoleName are no longer limited to built-in server roles. To add members
        to a built-in server role, set ServerRoleName to the name of the built-in
        server role.
      - The ServerRoleName will be created when Ensure is set to 'Present' (if it
        does not already exist), or removed if Ensure is set to 'Absent'.
    - Three new parameters are added; Members, MembersToInclude and MembersToExclude.
      - Members can be set to one or more logins, and those will _replace all_ the
        memberships in the server role.
      - MembersToInclude and MembersToExclude can be set to one or more logins that
        will add or remove memberships, respectively, in the server role. MembersToInclude
        and MembersToExclude _can not_ be used at the same time as parameter Members.
        But both MembersToInclude and MembersToExclude can be used together at the
        same time.
- Changes to xSQLServerSetup
  - Added a note to the README.md saying that it is not possible to add or remove
    features from a SQL Server failover cluster (issue #433).
  - Changed so that it reports false if the desired state is not correct (issue #432).
    - Added a test to make sure we always return false if a SQL Server failover
      cluster is missing features.
  - Helper function Connect-SQLAnalysis
    - Now has correct error handling, and throw does not used the unknown named
      parameter '-Message' (issue #436)
    - Added tests for Connect-SQLAnalysis
    - Changed to localized error messages.
    - Minor changes to error handling.
  - This adds better support for Addnode (issue #369).
  - Now it skips cluster validation för add node (issue #442).
  - Now it ignores parameters that are not allowed for action Addnode (issue #441).
  - Added support for vNext CTP 1.4 (issue #472).
- Added new resource
  - xSQLServerAlwaysOnAvailabilityGroupReplica
- Changes to xSQLServerDatabaseRecoveryModel
  - Fixed code style, removed SQLServerDatabaseRecoveryModel functions from xSQLServerHelper.
- Changes to xSQLServerAlwaysOnAvailabilityGroup
  - Fixed the permissions check loop so that it exits the loop after the function
    determines the required permissions are in place.
- Changes to xSQLServerAvailabilityGroupListener
  - Removed the dependency of SQLPS provider (issue #460).
  - Cleaned up code.
  - Added test for more coverage.
  - Fixed PSSA rule warnings (issue #255).
  - Parameter Ensure now defaults to 'Present' (issue #450).
- Changes to xSQLServerFirewall
  - Now it will correctly create rules when the resource is used for two or more
    instances on the same server (issue #461).
- Changes to xSQLServerEndpointPermission
  - Added description to the README.md
  - Cleaned up code (issue #257 and issue #231)
  - Now the default value for Ensure is 'Present'.
  - Removed dependency of SQLPS provider (issue #483).
  - Refactored tests so they use less code.
- Changes to README.md
  - Adding deprecated tag to xSQLServerFailoverClusterSetup, xSQLAOGroupEnsure and
    xSQLAOGroupJoin in README.md so it it more clear that these resources has been
    replaced by xSQLServerSetup, xSQLServerAlwaysOnAvailabilityGroup and
    xSQLServerAlwaysOnAvailabilityGroupReplica respectively.
- Changes to xSQLServerEndpoint
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Now SQLInstanceName is mandatory, and is a key, so
    SQLInstanceName has no longer a default value (issue #279).
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Parameter AuthorizedUser has been removed (issue #466,
    issue #275 and issue #80). Connect permissions can be set using the resource
    xSQLServerEndpointPermission.
  - Optional parameter IpAddress has been added. Default is to listen on any
    valid IP-address. (issue #232)
  - Parameter Port now has a default value of 5022.
  - Parameter Ensure now defaults to 'Present'.
  - Resource now supports changing IP address and changing port.
  - Added unit tests (issue #289)
  - Added examples.
- Changes to xSQLServerEndpointState
  - Cleaned up code, removed SupportsShouldProcess and fixed PSSA rules warnings
    (issue #258 and issue #230).
  - Now the default value for the parameter State is 'Started'.
  - Updated README.md with a description for the resources and revised the
    parameter descriptions.
  - Removed dependency of SQLPS provider (issue #481).
  - The parameter NodeName is no longer mandatory and has now the default value
    of $env:COMPUTERNAME.
  - The parameter Name is now a key so it is now possible to change the state on
    more than one endpoint on the same instance. _Note: The resource still only
    supports Database Mirror endpoints at this time._
- Changes to xSQLServerHelper module
  - Removing helper function Get-SQLAlwaysOnEndpoint because there is no resource
    using it any longer.
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Changed helper function Import-SQLPSModule to support SqlServer
    module (issue #91). The SqlServer module is the preferred module so if it is
    found it will be used, and if not found an attempt will be done to load SQLPS
    module instead.
- Changes to xSQLServerScript
  - Updated tests for this resource, because they failed when Import-SQLPSModule
    was updated.

## [6.0.0.0] - 2017-03-08

### Changed

- Changes to xSQLServerConfiguration
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The parameter SQLInstanceName is now mandatory.
  - Resource can now be used to define the configuration of two or more different
    DB instances on the same server.
- Changes to xSQLServerRole
  - xSQLServerRole now correctly reports that the desired state is present when
    the login is already a member of the server roles.
- Added new resources
  - xSQLServerAlwaysOnAvailabilityGroup
- Changes to xSQLServerSetup
  - Properly checks for use of SQLSysAdminAccounts parameter in $PSBoundParameters.
    The test now also properly evaluates the setup argument for SQLSysAdminAccounts.
  - xSQLServerSetup should now function correctly for the InstallFailoverCluster
    action, and also supports cluster shared volumes. Note that the AddNode action
    is not currently working.
  - It now detects that feature Client Connectivity Tools (CONN) and Client
    Connectivity Backwards Compatibility Tools (BC) is installed.
  - Now it can correctly determine the right cluster when only parameter
    InstallSQLDataDir is assigned a path (issue #401).
  - Now the only mandatory path parameter is InstallSQLDataDir when installing
    Database Engine (issue #400).
  - It now can handle mandatory parameters, and are not using wildcard to find
    the variables containing paths (issue #394).
  - Changed so that instead of connection to localhost it is using $env:COMPUTERNAME
    as the host name to which it connects. And for cluster installation it uses
    the parameter FailoverClusterNetworkName as the host name to which it connects
    (issue #407).
  - When called with Action = 'PrepareFailoverCluster', the SQLSysAdminAccounts
    and FailoverClusterGroup parameters are no longer passed to the setup process
    (issues #410 and 411).
  - Solved the problem that InstanceDir and InstallSQLDataDir could not be set to
    just a qualifier, i.e 'E:' (issue #418). All paths (except SourcePath) can now
    be set to just the qualifier.
- Enables CodeCov.io code coverage reporting.
- Added badge for CodeCov.io to README.md.

  - xSQLServerMemory
- Changes to xSQLServerMemory
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The mandatory parameter now include SQLInstanceName. The
    DynamicAlloc parameter is no longer mandatory
- Changes to xSQLServerDatabase
  - When the system is not in desired state the Test-TargetResource will now output
    verbose messages saying so.
- Changes to xSQLServerDatabaseOwner
  - Fixed code style, added updated parameter descriptions to schema.mof and README.md.

    [kb974524](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/974524) for more information.
  - Now it uses CIM cmdlets to get information from WMI classes.
  - Resolved all of the PSScriptAnalyzer warnings that was triggered in the common
    tests.
  - Improvement for service accounts to enable support for Managed Service Accounts
    as well as other nt authority accounts
