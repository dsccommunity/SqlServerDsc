# Integration tests for SqlServerDsc

## Debugging

Currently there are no possible to debug the commands on the service Appveyor
since it has not been configured in the `appveyor.yml`.

## Depends On

For it to be easier to write integration tests for a command that depends
on other command, each commands integration test should have run order number.

If an integration test is dependent on one or more integration test
then the run order for the new integration tests should be set to
a higher run order number than the highest run order of the dependent
integration tests.

**Below are the integration tests listed in the run order, and with the dependency
to each other. Dependencies are made to speed up the testing.**

Command | Run order # | Depends on # | Use instance
--- | --- | --- | ---
Install-SqlDscServer | 1 | - | -

## Integration Tests

### `Prerequisites`Â´

Makes sure all dependencies are in place. This integration test always runs
first.

### `Install-SqlDscServer`

Installs all the [instances](#instances).

## Dependencies

### SqlServer module

There is different module version of [_SqlServer_](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/SqlServer)
used depending on SQL Server release. The integration tests installs the
required module version according to the below table.

SQL Server release | SqlServer module version
--- | ---
SQL Server 2016 | 21.1.18256
SQL Server 2017 | 21.1.18256
SQL Server 2019 | 21.1.18256
SQL Server 2022 | 22.2.0

### Instances

These instances is available for integration tests.

<!-- cSpell:ignore DSCSQLTEST -->

Instance | Feature | State
--- | --- | ---
DSCSQLTEST | SQLENGINE |  Running
MSSQLSERVER | SQLENGINE | Stopped

All running Database Engine instances also have a SQL Server Agent that is started.

The instance DSCSQLTEST support mixed authentication mode, and will have
both Named Pipes and TCP/IP protocol enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> Some services are stopped to save memory on the build worker. See the
> column _State_.

#### Instance properties

- **Collation:** Finnish\_Swedish\_CI\_AS
- **InstallSharedDir:** C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server
- **InstallSharedWOWDir:** C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server

### Users

The following local users are created and can be used by integration tests.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
User | Password | Permission | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
.\SqlInstall | P@ssw0rd1 | Local Windows administrator and sysadmin | Runs Setup for all instances.
.\SqlAdmin | P@ssw0rd1 | Local Windows user and sysadmin | Administrator of all SQL Server instances.
.\svc-SqlPrimary | yig-C^Equ3 | Local Windows user. | Runs the SQL Server service.
.\svc-SqlAgentPri | yig-C^Equ3 | Local Windows user. | Runs the SQL Server Agent service.
.\svc-SqlSecondary | yig-C^Equ3 | Local Windows user. | Runs the SQL Server service in multi node scenarios.
.\svc-SqlAgentSec | yig-C^Equ3 | Local Windows user. | Runs the SQL Server Agent service in multi node scenarios.

Login | Password | Permission | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
sa | P@ssw0rd1 | sysadmin | Administrator of the Database Engine instances DSCSQLTEST.
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

### Image media (ISO)

The environment variable `$env:IsoDriveLetter` contains the drive letter
(e.g. G, H, I) where the image media is mounted. The environment variable
`$env:IsoDrivePath` contains the drive root path
(e.g. G:\\, H:\\, I:\\) where the image media is mounted.

This information can be used by integration tests that depends on
the image media.
